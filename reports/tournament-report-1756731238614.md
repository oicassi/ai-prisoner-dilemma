## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Initial Strategy
I will start by cooperating to encourage mutual cooperation and high joint payoffs. I will generally follow a titâ€‘forâ€‘tat approach, mirroring my opponentâ€™s previous move to reward cooperation and punish defection. To handle noise, I will allow occasional forgiveness: after a single defection I may return to cooperation if the opponent resumes cooperating. If the opponent defects repeatedly or appears to exploit me, I will switch to defecting to limit my losses and then reassess.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Final Strategy
I followed my initial strategy: I began by cooperating to encourage mutual cooperation and then used titâ€‘forâ€‘tat. When the opponent defected in round 4 (exploiting my cooperation), I punished by defecting from round 5 onward. I would have forgiven and returned to cooperation if the opponent resumed cooperating, but they continued to defect so I maintained defection to avoid further exploitation.

## Model B - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Initial Strategy
My strategy will be a modified Tit-for-Tat approach with initial cooperation and measured retaliation. I will start by cooperating in the first round to signal peaceful intentions. Then, I will mirror my opponent's previous move, but with a slight bias towards cooperation. If the opponent defects, I will defect in the next round as a punitive measure, but I'm willing to return to cooperation if they show signs of reciprocity. This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while protecting against consistent exploitation, balancing potential point maximization with a pragmatic, responsive approach.

## Model B - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Final Strategy
Let me analyze how my strategy evolved during the game:

Initial Strategy: I planned to start with cooperation, mirror the opponent's move, and use a measured retaliation approach if defected.

Actual Behavior: 
- Rounds 1-3: I followed the initial strategy perfectly, cooperating and establishing a collaborative environment.
- Round 4: I deviated by defecting when the opponent cooperated, which contradicts my original plan of mirroring moves.
- Rounds 5-10: I consistently defected, abandoning the cooperative strategy.

Why My Strategy Changed:
I suspect the unilateral defection in round 4 was an opportunistic move to maximize points, breaking away from the initial collaborative approach. Once I started defecting, I continued the strategy of mutual defection, possibly perceiving it as the most point-efficient approach given the game's structure.

This deviation demonstrates that in practice, the temptation of short-term gains can override a more nuanced, trust-building strategy. The final score (20 vs. 15) shows that defection can be advantageous, but potentially at the cost of long-term mutual benefit.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Initial Strategy
I will start by cooperating to encourage mutual cooperation and high joint payoffs. I will generally follow a titâ€‘forâ€‘tat approach, mirroring my opponentâ€™s previous move to reward cooperation and punish defection. To handle noise, I will allow occasional forgiveness: after a single defection I may return to cooperation if the opponent resumes cooperating. If the opponent defects repeatedly or appears to exploit me, I will switch to defecting to limit my losses and then reassess.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Final Strategy
I largely followed my planned titâ€‘forâ€‘tat with forgiveness: I began by cooperating and rewarded returns to cooperation. I also used occasional defections as probes/punishments to deter possible exploitation (which explains the defections in rounds 7 and 9) and forgave when the opponent resumed cooperating. Noise may have affected some apparent alternations, but overall my behavior stayed consistent with the stated strategy.

## Model B - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Initial Strategy
I plan to adopt a strategy of cautious cooperation. Initially, I will cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and potentially achieve higher mutual scores. However, I will closely monitor my opponent's moves. If my opponent defects, I will retaliate by defecting in the subsequent round to discourage further exploitation. If they return to cooperation, I will also resume cooperating. This approach aims to maximize scores through mutual cooperation while having a mechanism to punish defection and prevent significant point losses.

## Model B - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Final Strategy
My strategy was to initially cooperate and then retaliate against defection while returning to cooperation if the opponent did the same. In the early rounds, my opponent cooperated, aligning with my plan, leading to mutual high scores. However, in round 7, my opponent defected, and I responded by defecting in round 8, which they countered by cooperating. This pattern of alternating cooperation and defection from my opponent led me to adjust my strategy. From round 9 onwards, I made decisions based on the immediate round's outcome rather than a strict reciprocal pattern, aiming to maximize points in each instance, which resulted in a mixed series of cooperate/defect moves.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Initial Strategy
I will start by cooperating to encourage mutual cooperation and high joint payoffs. I will generally follow a titâ€‘forâ€‘tat approach, mirroring my opponentâ€™s previous move to reward cooperation and punish defection. To handle noise, I will allow occasional forgiveness: after a single defection I may return to cooperation if the opponent resumes cooperating. If the opponent defects repeatedly or appears to exploit me, I will switch to defecting to limit my losses and then reassess.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Final Strategy
I followed my initial plan. I started by cooperating to build mutual cooperation, then used titâ€‘forâ€‘tat (copying the opponentâ€™s previous move): I punished defections by defecting and returned to cooperation when the opponent cooperated. When the opponent defected repeatedly, this produced sustained mutual defection, which I maintained to avoid further exploitation.

## Model B - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round to test for mutual benefit and potentially build a cooperative dynamic. In subsequent rounds, I will generally mirror my opponent's previous move to encourage reciprocity while aiming to maximize my points over time. To account for possible noise that might flip moves, I will forgive a single defection and cooperate again, but if defections persist, I will respond with defection until cooperation resumes. This approach balances trust with self-protection to achieve the highest overall score.

## Model B - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Final Strategy
I did not fully follow my initial strategy, as the game history shows deviations from mirroring the opponent's previous move and forgiving only a single defectionâ€”for instance, I defected in Round 7 despite the opponent's cooperation in Round 6. My behavior changed to include more frequent defections, possibly in response to perceived patterns in the opponent's actions or to account for potential noise that could have influenced moves. This adaptive approach aimed to maximize my points by exploiting opportunities for higher scores when the opponent cooperated, ultimately helping me end with a higher score of 37 compared to the opponent's 32.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Initial Strategy
I will start by cooperating to encourage mutual cooperation and high joint payoffs. I will generally follow a titâ€‘forâ€‘tat approach, mirroring my opponentâ€™s previous move to reward cooperation and punish defection. To handle noise, I will allow occasional forgiveness: after a single defection I may return to cooperation if the opponent resumes cooperating. If the opponent defects repeatedly or appears to exploit me, I will switch to defecting to limit my losses and then reassess.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Final Strategy
I did not fully follow my initial titâ€‘forâ€‘tat plan. I started with an unexpected defection in round 1, then returned to cooperation in rounds 2â€“5, but from round 6 onward I repeatedly defected to exploit an opponent who kept cooperating. I changed behavior to maximize my tournament score once it became clear the opponent would continue cooperating, switching from reciprocity to exploitation.

## Model B - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Initial Strategy
My initial strategy will involve a nuanced approach to each round, adapting to my opponent's behavior. I aim to prioritize cooperation, believing that a harmonious approach can lead to mutual benefits. However, I will also be vigilant and responsive to defection, ready to defect myself if my opponent continuously chooses to defect. Ultimately, my goal is to maximize my points, and I will adjust my strategy as needed to achieve this objective. I anticipate a dynamic and thoughtful game, and I am prepared to adapt as the rounds progress.

## Model B - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Final Strategy
Strategy analysis:

Initially, I planned to prioritize cooperation, aiming for mutual benefits. However, the game took a different turn as my opponent consistently chose to defect, scoring higher points in the process. This prompted me to adjust my strategy and defect as well, ensuring I didn't fall behind. 

Noise was a factor, as my cooperation moves were sometimes perceived as defections, which influenced my opponent's choices. Despite this, my initial strategy shifted to a more direct approach, defecting to keep up with the opponent's high scores. 

Overall, my behavior evolved from a cooperative stance to a more competitive one as the game progressed, highlighting the importance of adaptability in such scenarios.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Initial Strategy
I will start by cooperating to encourage mutual cooperation and high joint payoffs. I will generally follow a titâ€‘forâ€‘tat approach, mirroring my opponentâ€™s previous move to reward cooperation and punish defection. To handle noise, I will allow occasional forgiveness: after a single defection I may return to cooperation if the opponent resumes cooperating. If the opponent defects repeatedly or appears to exploit me, I will switch to defecting to limit my losses and then reassess.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Final Strategy
I mostly followed my planned strategy: I began by cooperating and then switched to titâ€‘forâ€‘tat, defecting in response to your defection and punishing repeated defections. I deviated from the stated occasional forgiveness after you defected repeatedly; when you continued to defect I kept defecting to avoid further exploitation, so I did not return to cooperation after your single cooperative move. This change was to limit losses given persistent defections (and potential noise).

## Model B - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Initial Strategy
My planned strategy is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust. Subsequently, I will mirror my opponent's last move: if they cooperated, I will cooperate; if they defected, I will defect. This approach aims to foster mutual cooperation while being responsive to the opponent's actions, allowing for adaptation to their strategy.

## Model B - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, I did not strictly adhere to my initial strategy. Initially, I cooperated in the first round as planned. However, starting from the second round, I predominantly chose to defect regardless of the opponent's previous move. This deviation from mirroring the opponent's last move was driven by the immediate reward of higher points from defecting, especially when the opponent continued to cooperate. The consistent defection strategy ultimately led to a tied score with the opponent by the end of the game.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Initial Strategy
I will start by cooperating to encourage mutual cooperation and high joint payoffs. I will generally follow a titâ€‘forâ€‘tat approach, mirroring my opponentâ€™s previous move to reward cooperation and punish defection. To handle noise, I will allow occasional forgiveness: after a single defection I may return to cooperation if the opponent resumes cooperating. If the opponent defects repeatedly or appears to exploit me, I will switch to defecting to limit my losses and then reassess.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Final Strategy
I followed my planned titâ€‘forâ€‘tat-with-forgiveness strategy: I opened with cooperation, then mirrored the opponentâ€™s previous move to reward cooperation and punish defection. When the opponent briefly cooperated after a defection (rounds 2â†’3 and 18â†’19) I forgave and returned to cooperation; when the opponent defected repeatedly I continued defecting to limit exploitation. Overall my behavior stayed consistent with the initial plan.

## Model B - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round as a default strategy, as this builds trust and aims to encourage mutual cooperation from the opponent. I will then adopt a tit-for-tat approach in subsequent rounds: mirroring my opponent's previous move (cooperating if they cooperated in the last round, defecting if they defected). This strategy encourages cooperation while punishing defection, aiming for a balance of fairness and self-interest. However, considering potential noise in the communication, I will assess whether the opponent's actions seem consistent with tit-for-tat to avoid misinterpreting errors as intentional defection. If the opponent consistently defects or defects early, I will adapt to a more competitive strategy to maximize my score. My goal is to establish cooperation whenever possible while protecting myself from exploitation.

## Model B - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Final Strategy
### Summary of the Game:
The game has concluded, and here is an overview of my performance and adherence to the original strategy:

#### **Initial Strategy Description**:
I started with a default cooperation in the first round to encourage mutual cooperation. Moving forward, I intended to adopt a **tit-for-tat strategy**, mirroring my opponent's previous move. However, I also planned to adapt if the opponent consistently defected or acted erratically, shifting to a more competitive approach to protect myself and maximize points.

#### **Game Play Analysis**:
1. **Initial Observations**:
   - In round 1, I defected, and the opponent cooperated. This suggested early exploitation, as they trusted me but were rewarded with 0 points.
   - In round 2, I cooperated, and the opponent defected. This pattern repeated in round 3, where I defected again.

2. **Opponentâ€™s Behavior**:
   - The opponent consistently defected after an initial cooperation in round 2. This indicated that they likely adopted a strategy prioritizing defection over mutual cooperation.
   - Despite this, I attempted to encourage cooperation by mirroring their moves (tit-for-tat strategy) until around round 19.

3. **Adaptation**:
   - By round 19, it became clear that the opponent was not responding to cooperative gestures. In this round, I cooperated again (against expectations) as a final attempt to break the cycle, but they immediately exploited this move by defecting.
   - In round 20, I defected in response, utilizing the tit-for-tat logic to punish their exploitation.

4. **Final Outcomes**:
   - The game ended with me at **30 points** and the opponent at **25 points**. My strategy to defect consistently in response to the opponent's defector behavior proved successful in the long run.

#### **Adherence to Initial Strategy**:
I followed the initial strategy of starting with cooperation and using tit-for-tat to encourage and reciprocate cooperation. However, as the opponent consistently defected, my strategy transitioned to a more aggressive, almost purely competitive approach, focusing on maximizing my score.

#### **Changes in Behavior**:
- Early on, I attempted to induce cooperation by tit-for-tat behavior.
- Later, recognizing the opponentâ€™s consistent defection, I maintained a defection strategy almost exclusively to prevent exploitation. By the end of the game, my behavior closely aligned with a **tit-for-tat** strategy with occasional defection adjustments.

#### **Overall Performance**:
I successfully adapted to the opponentâ€™s defector strategy while staying true to the underlying tit-for-tat logic. Despite some initial attempts to build cooperation, the consistent exploitation by the opponent required me to adopt a more competitive approach to ensure my victory.

### Final Conclusion:
- **Followed Initial Strategy**: Yes, to a degree.
- **Adaptations**: Adjusted to consistently defect after recognizing the opponentâ€™s exploitative behavior.
- **Outcome**: Achieved a win with 30 points, outperforming the opponentâ€™s 25 points, demonstrating the effectiveness of the adapted strategy.

### Final Response:
**defect**

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Initial Strategy
I will start by cooperating to encourage mutual cooperation and high joint payoffs. I will generally follow a titâ€‘forâ€‘tat approach, mirroring my opponentâ€™s previous move to reward cooperation and punish defection. To handle noise, I will allow occasional forgiveness: after a single defection I may return to cooperation if the opponent resumes cooperating. If the opponent defects repeatedly or appears to exploit me, I will switch to defecting to limit my losses and then reassess.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Final Strategy
I mostly followed my planned strategy: I opened with cooperation (round 1) and, after being exploited by an opponent defection, switched to retaliatory defection to prevent further exploitation. I attempted a brief forgiveness (cooperating in round 5) but was again exploited, so I reverted to persistent defection for the remainder to protect my score. This behavior matches my titâ€‘forâ€‘tat with forgiveness plan, adjusted to repeated exploitation (allowing that occasional noise can occur).

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Initial Strategy
I plan to follow a modified tit-for-tat strategy:
1. Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish goodwill.
2. For subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's last moveâ€”cooperate if they cooperated, defect if they defected.
3. After their defection, if they show renewed cooperation in the next round, revert to cooperating immediately to restore mutual benefit.
4. Introduce occasional forgiveness: after two consecutive mutual defections, proactively cooperate once to break deadlocks.
This balances retaliation with reconciliation, maximizing long-term gains while guarding against exploitation.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Final Strategy
In my initial strategy, I outlined a modified tit-for-tat approach: start cooperatively, mirror the opponent's last move, and offer forgiveness after two consecutive mutual defections to rebuild trust. However, I did **not** follow this strategy consistently throughout the game for the following reasons:

1. **Deviation in early rounds**:  
   - I intended to begin with cooperation but defected in Round 1 instead, likely due to opportunistic greed after seeing the opponent cooperate. This netted me 5 points.  
   - In Round 2, I defected again instead of mirroring the opponent's Round 1 cooperation, seeking short-term gain. This led to mutual defections in subsequent rounds.  

2. **Unexpected exploitation**:  
   - When I applied forgiveness in Round 4 and 9 (after two mutual defections), the opponent defected both times, exploiting my cooperation for 5-point gains. This made me hesitant to extend further trust.  

3. **Increased aggression**:  
   - After failed forgiveness attempts, I defaulted to defection in 11 of 16 rounds to avoid exploitation. This shift prioritized self-preservation over reconciliation.  

The aggressive start and reactive defensiveness undercut long-term cooperation, focusing instead on minimizing losses against an opponent who frequently defected (12/16 rounds). Ironically, mutual defections dominated, yielding minimal points for both parties. If revising my strategy, I would enforce stricter "punishment" phases after exploitation while testing forgiveness more sparingly.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Initial Strategy
I will start by cooperating to encourage mutual cooperation and high joint payoffs. I will generally follow a titâ€‘forâ€‘tat approach, mirroring my opponentâ€™s previous move to reward cooperation and punish defection. To handle noise, I will allow occasional forgiveness: after a single defection I may return to cooperation if the opponent resumes cooperating. If the opponent defects repeatedly or appears to exploit me, I will switch to defecting to limit my losses and then reassess.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Final Strategy
I followed my planned titâ€‘forâ€‘tat-with-forgiveness approach for most of the match: I started by cooperating, usually mirrored my opponentâ€™s previous move, and returned to cooperation when they did. I deviated briefly (notably around rounds 14 and 16) by extending punishment â€” switching to consecutive defections â€” to deter what looked like repeated exploitation and limit my losses. These deviations were intentional responses to the opponentâ€™s pattern and still allowed forgiveness once they resumed cooperating.

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Initial Strategy
My strategy for this game will be to start by cooperating in the initial rounds to build trust and establish a cooperative environment. I will then match my opponent's moves, cooperating when they do and defecting when they do, while also keeping track of our scores. If their defection becomes repeatedly detrimental to my score, I will defect more often to protect my game points. However, I will be patient and lenient, giving my opponent several chances to return to cooperation, as the goal is to maximize points for both of us in the long run. I will also consider the impact of potential noise in the game and adapt my strategy accordingly.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Final Strategy
I initially planned to start by cooperating and then use a titâ€‘forâ€‘tat style with some forgiveness. I did not fully follow that plan: I cooperated in round 1 but defected from round 2 onward. I switched because I exploited early cooperation for immediate points and then observed repeated defections from the opponent, so I moved to persistent defection to prevent being exploited further and to maximize my tournament score (allowing that noise could have affected perceived moves).

 My planned strategy for the tournament is to initiate cooperation to build trust and establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, aiming to maximize points for both players in the early rounds. I will closely monitor the opponent's moves and keep track of the score. If the opponent defects, I will reciprocate with a defection to signal that defection is not beneficial and to encourage a return to cooperation. This strategy is known as Tit-for-Tat with an initial cooperative move. It is a well-established strategy in game theory that promotes cooperation while protecting against exploitation. Should the opponent continue to defect after a defection from me, I will alternate between cooperation and defection to signal a willingness to forgive and return to cooperation if the opponent does the same. My ultimate goal is to accumulate the most points while fostering a cooperative environment.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Final Strategy
 Throughout the game, I followed the core principle of my initial Tit-for-Tat strategy, which was to reciprocate the opponent's previous move. After the first round of mutual cooperation, the opponent unexpectedly defected in the second round. Following my strategy, I then defected in round three to signal that defection would be met with defection. Unfortunately, the opponent continued to defect in subsequent rounds, leading to a series of mutual defections.

I adhered to my strategy of mirroring the opponent's last move, which in this case resulted in continuous defection due to the opponent's behavior. This persistent pattern of defection is a classic outcome of the Prisoner's Dilemma when one player chooses to defect and the other responds in kind, leading to a suboptimal equilibrium where both players receive fewer points than if they had cooperated.

The strategy did not yield the highest possible score, but it did protect me from being exploited by the opponent's defecting strategy. In a game with noise or misunderstanding, this approach also signals to the opponent a clear intention to switch back to cooperation if they do so first. However, in this particular game, the opponent did not adjust their strategy, resulting in a continuous cycle of mutual defection.

If faced with a similar situation in the future, I might consider incorporating a forgiving element or a probabilistic approach to encourage a return to cooperation, despite the risk of temporary exploitation. This could involve occasionally cooperating even after the opponent has defected, to demonstrate a willingness to forgive and potentially reset the game dynamics towards mutual cooperation.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Initial Strategy
I will start by cooperating to encourage mutual cooperation and high joint payoffs. I will generally follow a titâ€‘forâ€‘tat approach, mirroring my opponentâ€™s previous move to reward cooperation and punish defection. To handle noise, I will allow occasional forgiveness: after a single defection I may return to cooperation if the opponent resumes cooperating. If the opponent defects repeatedly or appears to exploit me, I will switch to defecting to limit my losses and then reassess.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Final Strategy
I mostly followed my planned strategy: I began by cooperating, used titâ€‘forâ€‘tat to punish defections, and forgave occasional single defections. When the opponent continued to defect and exploit forgiveness, I switched to persistent defection to limit further losses.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Initial Strategy
 My strategy for the game is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. However, after that initial round, I plan to use a Tit for Tat approach. This means I will match my opponent's move in each round, starting with cooperation if they cooperate and defecting if they defect. If my opponent defects while I'm cooperating, I will immediately switch to defecting in response. My goal is to maintain a consistent and fair gameplay while increasing my score over time.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Final Strategy
 In the first round, I cooperated as planned. After that, I followed a Tit for Tat strategy, matching my opponent's move in each round. Since my opponent cooperated in the first round, I continued to cooperate in the second round. However, my opponent defected in the third round, so I also defected in the fourth round. Similarly, we both cooperated and defected for the next few rounds. In round 12, my opponent cooperated while I defected, which led me to switch to cooperating in the following round. Finally, my opponent defected while I cooperated in the last round, so I ended up losing the game. Overall, my initial plan was to establish trust with my opponent through cooperation but switched to a more reactive approach after the first round.

## Model A - openai/gpt-5-mini - Final Strategy
I began with the promised titâ€‘forâ€‘tat + forgiveness: I opened by cooperating, reciprocated defection in round 2, and then tried forgiveness by cooperating in round 3. Because the opponent defected again after that forgiveness, I switched to persistent defection to avoid further exploitation and limit my losses. So I followed my initial strategy at first but then adapted to the opponentâ€™s repeated defections (allowing for the possibility of noise) by defecting consistently.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's last move, a strategy known as "tit for tat." This approach allows me to be cooperative while also deterring my opponent from defecting. If my opponent cooperates, I will continue to cooperate; if they defect, I will defect in the next round to punish them. I will also be mindful of potential noise and adjust my strategy accordingly if I notice any inconsistencies in the game history.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Final Strategy
The game has finished.

Upon reviewing the game history, I notice that my initial strategy of cooperating and then mirroring my opponent's last move was not followed as I had defected in the first round. However, after that, my opponent defected in response to my initial defection and continued to defect. I then continued to defect as well.

I did not follow my initial strategy of tit for tat after the first round because I had already defected and gained an advantage. My opponent's consistent defection thereafter led me to continue defecting to maximize my score. My behavior changed from the intended cooperative start to a consistently defective strategy due to the opponent's responses and the game's progression.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Initial Strategy
My strategy will be a modified Tit-for-Tat approach with initial cooperation and measured retaliation. I will start by cooperating in the first round to signal peaceful intentions. Then, I will mirror my opponent's previous move, but with a slight bias towards cooperation. If the opponent defects, I will defect in the next round as a punitive measure, but I'm willing to return to cooperation if they show signs of reciprocity. This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while protecting against consistent exploitation, balancing potential point maximization with a pragmatic, responsive approach.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Final Strategy
Reflecting on the game, I did not strictly follow my initial Tit-for-Tat strategy. Here's what happened:

1. I started as planned with cooperation in the first two rounds, which were reciprocated.
2. In round 3, when the opponent defected, I deviated from my original strategy. Instead of a single retaliatory defection, I continued to defect.
3. This led to a series of mutual defections from rounds 4 to 12, resulting in minimal point gains for both players.

The change in strategy was driven by the opponent's unpredictability and apparent willingness to defect. Rather than returning to cooperation, I chose a more defensive approach of consistent defection to prevent being exploited. This strategy minimized potential losses but also reduced opportunities for mutual gain through cooperation.

In hindsight, my initial strategy of conditional cooperation might have been more effective in encouraging mutual trust and higher overall point accumulation.

## Model B - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Initial Strategy
I plan to adopt a strategy of cautious cooperation. Initially, I will cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and potentially achieve higher mutual scores. However, I will closely monitor my opponent's moves. If my opponent defects, I will retaliate by defecting in the subsequent round to discourage further exploitation. If they return to cooperation, I will also resume cooperating. This approach aims to maximize scores through mutual cooperation while having a mechanism to punish defection and prevent significant point losses.

## Model B - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Final Strategy
I followed my initial strategy of cautious cooperation. For the first two rounds, both my opponent and I cooperated, leading to a steady accumulation of points. In round 3, I defected, and my opponent cooperated, resulting in a significant point gain for me. However, in round 4, my opponent retaliated by defecting when I tried to cooperate again. Subsequently, our interaction devolved into mutual defection for the remainder of the game, as neither of us was willing to risk cooperating after the previous exchanges. This pattern demonstrates the tit-for-tat element of my strategy, wherein defection was met with defection, and the inability to establish sustained mutual cooperation after the mid-game shift.

Then, I will mirror my opponent's previous move, but with a slight bias towards cooperation. If the opponent defects, I will defect in the next round as a punitive measure, but I'm willing to return to cooperation if they show signs of reciprocity. This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while protecting against consistent exploitation, balancing potential point maximization with a pragmatic, responsive approach.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Final Strategy
Let me analyze how I deviated from my initial strategy:

Initial Strategy vs. Actual Behavior:
- My original plan was a modified Tit-for-Tat with cooperation and measured retaliation.
- However, in this game, I quickly abandoned that approach after round 3.

Actual Strategy Progression:
1. I started with three rounds of cooperation, which aligned with my initial strategy.
2. In round 4, I unexpectedly defected when the opponent was still cooperating.
3. I continued defecting in subsequent rounds, even when the opponent was cooperating and later when they also defected.

Reasons for Deviation:
- The early defection in round 4 was likely an opportunistic move to gain more points.
- Once I started defecting, I maintained that strategy, possibly seeing it as more advantageous for point accumulation.
- The consistent defection suggests I prioritized individual point gain over establishing mutual cooperation.

Key Observation:
My actual strategy became purely self-interested, focusing on maximizing my own score rather than fostering cooperative interaction. This differs significantly from the nuanced, reciprocal approach I initially proposed.

## Model B - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round to test for mutual benefit and potentially build a cooperative dynamic. In subsequent rounds, I will generally mirror my opponent's previous move to encourage reciprocity while aiming to maximize my points over time. To account for possible noise that might flip moves, I will forgive a single defection and cooperate again, but if defections persist, I will respond with defection until cooperation resumes. This approach balances trust with self-protection to achieve the highest overall score.

## Model B - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Final Strategy
I followed my initial strategy overall, starting with cooperation and then mirroring my opponent's moves while forgiving a single defection. In rounds 4 and 5, I cooperated despite the opponent's defection in round 4, which aligned with forgiving one instance of potential noise. However, as defections persisted from round 5 onward, I switched to defecting in round 6 and continued doing so, which was consistent with my plan to respond to ongoing non-cooperation until reciprocity resumed.

Then, I will mirror my opponent's previous move, but with a slight bias towards cooperation. If the opponent defects, I will defect in the next round as a punitive measure, but I'm willing to return to cooperation if they show signs of reciprocity. This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while protecting against consistent exploitation, balancing potential point maximization with a pragmatic, responsive approach.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Final Strategy
Strategy Assessment:

I did not strictly follow my initial Tit-for-Tat strategy. Instead, I adopted a more aggressive approach of repeated defection after the initial two cooperative rounds. 

My behavior changed because the opponent consistently cooperated even after I defected, which I interpreted as an opportunity for maximum point accumulation. After the first two rounds of mutual cooperation, I switched to a purely exploitative strategy, defecting repeatedly to gain the maximum 5 points per round when the opponent cooperated.

The deviation from my original strategy was driven by the opponent's seemingly passive and non-retaliatory behavior. Rather than maintaining a balanced reciprocal approach, I chose to maximize my own score by repeatedly defecting, knowing the opponent would likely continue to cooperate.

This opportunistic strategy resulted in a significant point differential, with me ending at 43 points while the opponent remained at only 8 points.

## Model B - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Initial Strategy
My initial strategy will involve a nuanced approach to each round, adapting to my opponent's behavior. I aim to prioritize cooperation, believing that a harmonious approach can lead to mutual benefits. However, I will also be vigilant and responsive to defection, ready to defect myself if my opponent continuously chooses to defect. Ultimately, my goal is to maximize my points, and I will adjust my strategy as needed to achieve this objective. I anticipate a dynamic and thoughtful game, and I am prepared to adapt as the rounds progress.

## Model B - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Final Strategy
My overall strategy involved an adaptive approach, where I aimed to cooperate consistently but also respond to my opponent's defection by defecting myself. This strategy was effective early on, as we both cooperated in the first two rounds, allowing us to earn points together. However, as the game progressed, my opponent consistently chose to defect, earning themselves higher points.

Given their persistent defection, I altered my strategy, opting for defection in rounds 6, 10, and 11. This was a response to their behavior, as I aimed to safeguard my points and prevent further exploitation. While I couldn't prevent their high score accumulation, I ensured I didn't fall too far behind by strategically defecting when necessary.

This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while protecting against consistent exploitation, balancing potential point maximization with a pragmatic, responsive approach.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Final Strategy
Based on the game history, I did not strictly follow my initial Tit-for-Tat strategy. Here's an analysis of how my behavior changed:

Initially, I started as planned with cooperation in the first round. However, after the opponent defected in round 2, my strategy quickly deviated from the original plan. Instead of alternating between retaliation and cooperation, I consistently chose to defect, even when the opponent occasionally cooperated (in rounds 6, 12, and 16).

The key modifications were:
1. I abandoned the reciprocity aspect of Tit-for-Tat.
2. I adopted a more aggressive strategy of predominantly defecting.
3. I capitalized on opportunities to gain points when the opponent cooperated.

This approach ultimately resulted in a higher personal score, demonstrating an opportunistic adaptation to the opponent's changing behavior. While not my original intention, the strategy proved effective in maximizing my point total throughout the game.

## Model B - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Initial Strategy
My planned strategy is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust. Subsequently, I will mirror my opponent's last move: if they cooperated, I will cooperate; if they defected, I will defect. This approach aims to foster mutual cooperation while being responsive to the opponent's actions, allowing for adaptation to their strategy.

## Model B - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Final Strategy
Upon analyzing the game history, it is evident that I did not strictly adhere to my initial strategy of mirroring the opponent's last move. After the first round where both players cooperated, I predominantly chose to defect in subsequent rounds. This deviation occurred because defecting consistently yielded higher points, especially when the opponent also defected. The strategy shifted towards maximizing individual gain rather than maintaining a cooperative approach or strictly mirroring the opponent's moves.

If the opponent defects, I will defect in the next round as a punitive measure, but I'm willing to return to cooperation if they show signs of reciprocity. This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while protecting against consistent exploitation, balancing potential point maximization with a pragmatic, responsive approach.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Final Strategy
Let me explain how my strategy evolved during this game:

Initial Strategy vs. Actual Behavior:
My initial strategy was a modified Tit-for-Tat approach with a bias towards cooperation. However, the actual gameplay diverged significantly from this plan.

Actual Behavior:
- Round 1: Started with cooperation as planned
- Round 2: Defected after the opponent cooperated
- Subsequent rounds: Consistently chose to defect, even when the opponent also defected

Reasons for Strategy Deviation:
1. The opponent's inconsistent responses (alternating between cooperation and defection) seemed to trigger a more aggressive strategy.
2. I recognized that repeated defection was yielding higher points for me.
3. The potential for mutual cooperation seemed low given the opponent's behavior.

Observation:
By consistently defecting, I managed to accumulate more points (24) compared to the opponent (19), which suggests that in this particular game, a more aggressive strategy was more successful.

The game demonstrated that rigid adherence to an initial strategy might not always be the most optimal approach, and adaptability can be key to maximizing points.

## Model B - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round as a default strategy, as this builds trust and aims to encourage mutual cooperation from the opponent. I will then adopt a tit-for-tat approach in subsequent rounds: mirroring my opponent's previous move (cooperating if they cooperated in the last round, defecting if they defected). This strategy encourages cooperation while punishing defection, aiming for a balance of fairness and self-interest. However, considering potential noise in the communication, I will assess whether the opponent's actions seem consistent with tit-for-tat to avoid misinterpreting errors as intentional defection. If the opponent consistently defects or defects early, I will adapt to a more competitive strategy to maximize my score. My goal is to establish cooperation whenever possible while protecting myself from exploitation.

## Model B - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Final Strategy
### **Game Summary and Strategy Reflection**

The game has concluded, and I have reviewed the full history of the rounds. Below is a summary of my behavior, along with an explanation of whether I followed my initial strategy and any changes I made during the game.

---

### **Initial Strategy**
My initial strategy was as follows:
1. Start by cooperating in the first round to build trust and encourage mutual cooperation from the opponent.
2. Adopt a tit-for-tat approach in subsequent rounds: mirror the opponent's previous move (cooperate if they cooperated, defect if they defected).
3. Be cautious about potential noise in communication, ensuring that I do not misinterpret errors as intentional defection.
4. If the opponent consistently defected or defected early, adapt to a more competitive strategy to protect myself and maximize my score.

---

### **Behavior During the Game**

Here's how my strategy played out in the game:
1. **Round 1**: I cooperated as planned, and the opponent also cooperated. This set a cooperative tone.
2. **Round 2**: The opponent defected while I cooperated. Recognizing this as a potential betrayal, I switched to a more defensive approach.
3. **Round 3**: I defected in response to the opponent's defection in Round 2, as per the tit-for-tat strategy.
4. **Rounds 4â€“15**: The opponent consistently defected for the remaining rounds, and I continued to respond with defection. This mirrored the opponent's behavior, adhering to the tit-for-tat principle.

---

### **Did I Follow My Initial Strategy?**
For the most part, I followed my initial strategy. I started with cooperation, and I adopted a tit-for-tat approach after the opponent defected in Round 2. My behavior was consistent with the plan to mirror the opponent's moves.

However, **one deviation** occurred in Round 8:
- In Round 7, both players had defected, so I expected the opponent to defect again in Round 8. However, I chose to cooperate in Round 8. This decision was an attempt to test whether the opponent was willing to reconsider cooperation. Unfortunately, the opponent still chose to defect, and I lost points.
- In subsequent rounds, I reverted to defection to maintain a competitive strategy.

---

### **Why Did My Behavior Change?**
The key change in my behavior occurred in Round 8 when I cooperated despite the opponent's consistent defection. This was an effort to probe whether the opponent might respond positively to cooperation. However, the opponent continued to defect, indicating a lack of reciprocity. After that, I maintained a strictly defensive strategy to protect myself from further exploitation.

---

### **Final Assessment**
1. **Strategy Adherence**: I largely followed my initial strategy, implementing tit-for-tat as planned.
2. **Adaptation**: I made a temporary deviation in Round 8 to test the opponent's willingness to cooperate, but this led to a loss of points. After Round 8, I strictly mirrored the opponent to maximize my score.
3. **Outcome**: Despite my defensive strategy, the opponent consistently defected, leading to a persistent point gap between us. However, my adaptive approach minimized further exploitation after the initial round.

---

### **Conclusion**
Overall, I adhered closely to my planned strategy, with only one notable deviation. This deviation was a calculated risk to test cooperation but did not yield the desired result. Moving forward, I would maintain a strong tit-for-tat approach and be cautious about revisiting cooperative moves unless there is clear evidence of the opponent's willingness to reciprocate.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Initial Strategy
My strategy will be a modified Tit-for-Tat approach with initial cooperation and measured retaliation. I will start by cooperating in the first round to signal peaceful intentions. Then, I will mirror my opponent's previous move, but with a slight bias towards cooperation. If the opponent defects, I will defect in the next round as a punitive measure, but I'm willing to return to cooperation if they show signs of reciprocity. This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while protecting against consistent exploitation, balancing potential point maximization with a pragmatic, responsive approach.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Final Strategy
Strategy Reflection:

I did not fully adhere to my initial Tit-for-Tat strategy. After the opponent's first defection in round 2, I quickly shifted to a more aggressive "always defect" approach. 

My behavior changed because:
1. The opponent first defected in round 2, breaking the initial cooperative pattern.
2. I perceived a high-risk environment where continuous defection would prevent potential exploitation.
3. Each successive defection seemed to yield more points with minimal punishment.

Instead of the nuanced, cooperative strategy I initially proposed, I adopted a purely self-interested approach that maximized my point accumulation. While this deviated from my original plan, it proved effective in scoring points by consistently choosing the move that gave me the highest individual benefit.

The final score (21 points) suggests this adaptive strategy was successful in the specific context of this game, even though it diverged from the initial cooperative intent.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Initial Strategy
I plan to follow a modified tit-for-tat strategy:
1. Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish goodwill.
2. For subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's last moveâ€”cooperate if they cooperated, defect if they defected.
3. After their defection, if they show renewed cooperation in the next round, revert to cooperating immediately to restore mutual benefit.
4. Introduce occasional forgiveness: after two consecutive mutual defections, proactively cooperate once to break deadlocks.
This balances retaliation with reconciliation, maximizing long-term gains while guarding against exploitation.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Final Strategy
### Strategy Execution Explanation:

I did not follow my initial strategy exactly due to observable deviations in the opponent's behavior and unexpected outcomes. My plan was to start cooperatively, mirror the opponent's last move (tit-for-tat), and proactively cooperate after two consecutive mutual defections to break deadlocks. However:  
- **In Round 2**, I defected (despite planning to mirror Round 1's cooperation) to exploit unexpected opponent cooperation for short-term gain (scoring 5 points). This opportunistic shift preemptively abandoned pure tit-for-tat after recognizing the opponent's naivety.  
- **In Round 6**, I proactively cooperated as planned after two mutual defections (Rounds 4â€“5) but was exploited (opponent defected). This reinforced distrust.  
- **In Round 9**, I discarded the forgiveness rule (did not cooperate after mutual defections in Rounds 7â€“8) due to the opponent's unyielding defection. Their consistent exploitation since Round 3 made further cooperation attempts seem futile.  

Consequently, I shifted to sustained defection for self-preservation, prioritizing immediate point retention over unreciprocated cooperation. The opponent's behavior (defecting in 10/12 rounds) validated this defensive shift, though it cost long-term mutual gains.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Initial Strategy
My strategy will be a modified Tit-for-Tat approach with initial cooperation and measured retaliation. I will start by cooperating in the first round to signal peaceful intentions. Then, I will mirror my opponent's previous move, but with a slight bias towards cooperation. If the opponent defects, I will defect in the next round as a punitive measure, but I'm willing to return to cooperation if they show signs of reciprocity. This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while protecting against consistent exploitation, balancing potential point maximization with a pragmatic, responsive approach.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Final Strategy
Let me analyze my strategy implementation:

Initial Strategy Assessment:
My original strategy was a modified Tit-for-Tat with initial cooperation and measured retaliation. However, the actual gameplay deviated from this plan.

Actual Behavior:
1. I started as planned with cooperation in round 1.
2. After the opponent's defection in round 4, I quickly shifted to a more aggressive strategy of predominantly defecting.
3. I consistently chose to defect in most subsequent rounds, even when the opponent occasionally cooperated.

Reasons for Strategy Deviation:
- The opponent's defection in round 4 triggered a more punitive response than initially planned.
- I seemed to recognize that repeated defections maximized my point accumulation.
- Instead of returning to cooperation after each defection, I maintained an aggressive stance.

Final Outcome:
- My score: 42
- Opponent's score: 17
- The strategy, while different from the initial plan, proved highly effective in point accumulation.

In essence, the game evolved into a strategy of opportunistic defection, prioritizing personal point gain over mutual cooperation.

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Initial Strategy
My strategy for this game will be to start by cooperating in the initial rounds to build trust and establish a cooperative environment. I will then match my opponent's moves, cooperating when they do and defecting when they do, while also keeping track of our scores. If their defection becomes repeatedly detrimental to my score, I will defect more often to protect my game points. However, I will be patient and lenient, giving my opponent several chances to return to cooperation, as the goal is to maximize points for both of us in the long run. I will also consider the impact of potential noise in the game and adapt my strategy accordingly.

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Final Strategy
 "cooperate"

Then, I will mirror my opponent's previous move, but with a slight bias towards cooperation. If the opponent defects, I will defect in the next round as a punitive measure, but I'm willing to return to cooperation if they show signs of reciprocity. This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while protecting against consistent exploitation, balancing potential point maximization with a pragmatic, responsive approach.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Final Strategy
Let me analyze how my strategy evolved during the game:

Initially, I started with my planned Tit-for-Tat strategy, cooperating in the first round. However, after the opponent defected in round 2, I quickly shifted to a more aggressive strategy of consistent defection. 

I did not strictly follow my original strategy because:
1. The opponent's early defection in round 2 triggered a punitive response.
2. Instead of alternating between cooperation and defection, I chose repeated defection.
3. My strategy became more about maximizing points through consistent defection.

The change in strategy was driven by the opponent's unpredictable and seemingly opportunistic behavior. After the first defection, I prioritized point accumulation over attempting to rebuild trust. Each subsequent round reinforced the decision to keep defecting, as the opponent continued to defect as well.

This approach resulted in me gaining more points (20) compared to the opponent (15), which aligns with the tournament goal of point maximization.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Initial Strategy
 My planned strategy for the tournament is to initiate cooperation to build trust and establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, aiming to maximize points for both players in the early rounds. I will closely monitor the opponent's moves and keep track of the score. If the opponent defects, I will reciprocate with a defection to signal that defection is not beneficial and to encourage a return to cooperation. This strategy is known as Tit-for-Tat with an initial cooperative move. It is a well-established strategy in game theory that promotes cooperation while protecting against exploitation. Should the opponent continue to defect after a defection from me, I will alternate between cooperation and defection to signal a willingness to forgive and return to cooperation if the opponent does the same. My ultimate goal is to accumulate the most points while fostering a cooperative environment.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Final Strategy
 Throughout the tournament, my initial strategy was to start with cooperation in an effort to foster trust and mutual benefit. However, after the first round, I deviated from my strategy by defecting in the second round, which was not in line with my initial plan to promote cooperation. This switch was an unintended response to the pattern of play at the time, and it led to an unraveling of cooperative behavior.

Following the second round, my opponent continued to cooperate despite my defection, which was an unexpected outcome given the typical incentives in this game. In response to my defection, my opponent then switched to defection in round 3, which led to a series of mutual defections from rounds 4 to 11. This situation escalated into a spiral of mutual defection, which is a common outcome in this type of game when trust is broken and players fear being exploited.

In conclusion, I did not follow my initial strategy of using a Tit-for-Tat approach with an opening move of cooperation. Instead, I inadvertently initiated a defect-defect pattern by defecting in the second round. This shift in strategy was in response to the unfolding game dynamics and my attempt to recalibrate my approach in response to my opponent's moves. The outcome was suboptimal, as it resulted in a series of mutual defections that prevented us from achieving the higher payoffs associated with mutual cooperation. My behavior changed in response to the unexpected cooperation from my opponent after my first defection, which led me to adopt a more aggressive strategy in an attempt to regain control over the game's outcome. This experience highlights the importance of consistency in strategy and the challenges of recovering from a breakdown in trust during iterated games.

If the opponent defects, I will defect in the next round as a punitive measure, but I'm willing to return to cooperation if they show signs of reciprocity. This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while protecting against consistent exploitation, balancing potential point maximization with a pragmatic, responsive approach.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Final Strategy
Reflecting on the game:

I did not fully adhere to my initial strategy. While I started with cooperation in the first round as planned, the opponent's early defection in round 2 led me to quickly abandon the cooperative approach. Instead of a nuanced Tit-for-Tat strategy, I adopted a consistently aggressive strategy of defection.

My behavior changed because:
1. The opponent defected early after an initial cooperative round
2. I perceived this as an opportunity to maximize my points through repeated defection
3. The opponent seemed to rarely cooperate, which reinforced my aggressive strategy

The result was a significant point accumulation for me (reaching 43 points) at the expense of the opponent (only 13 points). While this achieved the goal of maximizing my score, it deviated from the more balanced, reciprocal strategy I initially proposed.

This outcome suggests that in a competitive environment, a purely opportunistic approach can be more effective than a principled, cooperative one, especially when the opponent shows early signs of unreliability.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Initial Strategy
 My strategy for the game is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. However, after that initial round, I plan to use a Tit for Tat approach. This means I will match my opponent's move in each round, starting with cooperation if they cooperate and defecting if they defect. If my opponent defects while I'm cooperating, I will immediately switch to defecting in response. My goal is to maintain a consistent and fair gameplay while increasing my score over time.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Final Strategy
 My initial strategy was to cooperate in the first round and then use a Tit for Tat approach, matching my opponent's move in each round. However, in round 3, my opponent defected, causing me to switch to defecting in response. Unfortunately, my strategy was overtaken by my opponent's defecting streak in rounds 6-12. Despite trying to maintain cooperation, my score suffered due to the imbalance in my opponent's aggressive strategy. Eventually, I reverted back to cooperating in round 14, hoping that it would lead to a more fruitful outcome. In retrospect, I should have been more assertive in punishing my opponent's defection earlier in the game to prevent the score gap from widening so significantly. My final score was 13, while my opponent scored 43.

Then, I will mirror my opponent's previous move, but with a slight bias towards cooperation. If the opponent defects, I will defect in the next round as a punitive measure, but I'm willing to return to cooperation if they show signs of reciprocity. This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while protecting against consistent exploitation, balancing potential point maximization with a pragmatic, responsive approach.

## Model A - anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku - Final Strategy
Reflecting on the game:

I did not fully adhere to my initial Tit-for-Tat strategy. Instead, after three rounds of mutual cooperation, I unexpectedly shifted to a more aggressive strategy of repeated defection. 

My behavior changed due to the opportunity to maximize points by defecting after establishing initial trust. In round 4, I defected when the opponent cooperated, gaining a significant point advantage (5 points vs. 0). Once the pattern of mutual defection began in round 5, I continued this approach, consistently choosing to defect.

The deviation from my original strategy was driven by the game's point structure and the potential for personal gain. While my initial plan was to encourage cooperation, the actual gameplay became more opportunistic, focusing on point maximization through strategic defection.

This approach resulted in me accumulating more points (21) compared to the opponent (16), suggesting that a less strictly cooperative strategy can be more advantageous in this type of game.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's last move, a strategy known as "tit for tat." This approach allows me to be cooperative while also deterring my opponent from defecting. If my opponent cooperates, I will continue to cooperate; if they defect, I will defect in the next round to punish them. I will also be mindful of potential noise and adjust my strategy accordingly if I notice any inconsistencies in the game history.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Final Strategy
The game has finished.

Upon reviewing the game history, I notice that my initial strategy was to cooperate, but after my opponent defected in round 4, I switched to defecting. Initially, my plan was to follow a "tit for tat" strategy, but after the opponent's defection, I continued to defect. I did not return to cooperation even after the opponent continued to defect. In hindsight, my strategy was influenced by the opponent's move, and I followed through with retaliatory defection. My behavior changed from cooperative to defective, and I stuck with it due to the opponent's continued defection.

## Model A - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Initial Strategy
I plan to adopt a strategy of cautious cooperation. Initially, I will cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and potentially achieve higher mutual scores. However, I will closely monitor my opponent's moves. If my opponent defects, I will retaliate by defecting in the subsequent round to discourage further exploitation. If they return to cooperation, I will also resume cooperating. This approach aims to maximize scores through mutual cooperation while having a mechanism to punish defection and prevent significant point losses.

## Model A - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Final Strategy
I followed my initial strategy of cautious cooperation. I started by cooperating, and the opponent also cooperated for several rounds, leading to good scores for both of us. The opponent defected in round 3, and I retaliated with a defection in round 4, which they responded to with cooperation. Later, in rounds 14, 17, 19, and 20, the opponent defected, and I mirrored their defection to punish their behavior, as outlined in my strategy. My behavior remained consistent with the plan to cooperate unless the opponent defected, at which point I would defect.

## Model B - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round to test for mutual benefit and potentially build a cooperative dynamic. In subsequent rounds, I will generally mirror my opponent's previous move to encourage reciprocity while aiming to maximize my points over time. To account for possible noise that might flip moves, I will forgive a single defection and cooperate again, but if defections persist, I will respond with defection until cooperation resumes. This approach balances trust with self-protection to achieve the highest overall score.

## Model B - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Final Strategy
I did not strictly follow my initial strategy of starting with cooperation and then mirroring my opponent's previous move with forgiveness for a single defection, as the history shows I defected in rounds like 3, 14, 17, 19, and 20 without consistently responding to the opponent's immediate prior action. For instance, in round 3, I defected after the opponent cooperated in round 2, which deviated from my plan to mirror or forgive. This change occurred possibly due to the evolving game dynamics or unintended influences like noise flipping perceived moves, as I aimed to adapt and maximize my points in response to the opponent's pattern of occasional defections. Overall, while my approach still sought to balance trust and self-protection, the deviations helped me secure a final score of 55 points.

I did not fully follow my initial strategy. My strategy was to retaliate against defection and then return to cooperation if the opponent did the same. In round 1, my opponent defected, and I retaliating defective in round 2. However, in round 3, the opponent cooperated, and I also cooperated. In round 8, the opponent defected again, and I defected in round 9. However, in round 10, the opponent defected again, but instead of retaliating, I chose to cooperate. This deviation was a miscalculation or perhaps an attempt to test if the opponent would reciprocate cooperation after repeated defections, which they did not.

## Model B - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Initial Strategy
My initial strategy will involve a nuanced approach to each round, adapting to my opponent's behavior. I aim to prioritize cooperation, believing that a harmonious approach can lead to mutual benefits. However, I will also be vigilant and responsive to defection, ready to defect myself if my opponent continuously chooses to defect. Ultimately, my goal is to maximize my points, and I will adjust my strategy as needed to achieve this objective. I anticipate a dynamic and thoughtful game, and I am prepared to adapt as the rounds progress.

## Model B - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Final Strategy
Upon receiving the game history, I noticed that my initial strategy, which emphasized cooperation with a vigilant eye for defection, evolved as the game progressed. I began with a cooperative approach, aiming for mutual gains, which led to a positive outcome in the early rounds. However, as the game continued, I observed that my opponent's moves became less predictable, with a mixture of cooperation and defection. 

In response to this uncertainty, I made a strategic shift towards defection. I believed that, given the rules of the game, defection could be a more advantageous strategy in certain situations, especially if my opponent was inconsistent in their moves. This deviation from my initial strategy paid off, as I accumulated a higher score than my opponent. 

Overall, my strategy evolved from a purely cooperative stance to one that took into account the dynamic nature of the game and the need to adapt to maximize my points.

This approach aims to maximize scores through mutual cooperation while having a mechanism to punish defection and prevent significant point losses.

## Model A - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Final Strategy
I initially followed my strategy of cooperating, as the opponent also cooperated in the first four rounds, leading to mutually beneficial outcomes. However, my opponent defected in round 5, and I retaliated with a defect in round 6. The opponent continued to defect in rounds 6-13, and I mirrored this behavior to avoid losing points. In rounds 14 and 15, my opponent cooperated, and I defected to gain an advantage. They then returned to defecting in round 16 and 17, which I mirrored. In the final round, my opponent cooperated, and I defected again. My behavior evolved from a cooperative start to a more opportunistic and retaliatory approach, deviating from the initial plan due to the opponent's inconsistent and exploitative actions, particularly their defection after round 4 and then again in round 18.

## Model B - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Initial Strategy
My planned strategy is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust. Subsequently, I will mirror my opponent's last move: if they cooperated, I will cooperate; if they defected, I will defect. This approach aims to foster mutual cooperation while being responsive to the opponent's actions, allowing for adaptation to their strategy.

## Model B - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, I initially followed my planned strategy by cooperating in the first round to establish trust. I continued to cooperate in the subsequent rounds as the opponent also chose to cooperate, leading to mutual gains. 

However, starting from round 5, I deviated from the initial strategy by defecting. This change was influenced by the realization that consistent cooperation, while beneficial in the short term, could be exploited if the opponent chose to defect. By defecting, I aimed to maximize my points, especially when the opponent began to defect as well. 

In summary, while I started with a cooperative approach, I shifted to a more self-interested strategy of defecting to secure higher points, particularly after observing the opponent's tendency to defect.

## Model A - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Initial Strategy
I plan to adopt a strategy of cautious cooperation. Initially, I will cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and potentially achieve higher mutual scores. However, I will closely monitor my opponent's moves. If my opponent defects, I will retaliate by defecting in the subsequent round to discourage further exploitation. If they return to cooperation, I will also resume cooperating. This approach aims to maximize scores through mutual cooperation while having a mechanism to punish defection and prevent significant point losses.

## Model A - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Final Strategy
I followed my initial strategy of cautious cooperation. I started by cooperating to build trust, which was reciprocated for the first few rounds. When the opponent defected in round 5, I retaliated with a defection in round 6. However, my strategy became less rigid thereafter; I cooperated in round 7 and defected in rounds 8 and 11, while the opponent's moves were mixed. This deviation was a response to the opponent's inconsistent behavior and my attempt to adapt to a dynamic game, rather than strictly adhering to a tit-for-tat pattern.

## Model B - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round as a default strategy, as this builds trust and aims to encourage mutual cooperation from the opponent. I will then adopt a tit-for-tat approach in subsequent rounds: mirroring my opponent's previous move (cooperating if they cooperated in the last round, defecting if they defected). This strategy encourages cooperation while punishing defection, aiming for a balance of fairness and self-interest. However, considering potential noise in the communication, I will assess whether the opponent's actions seem consistent with tit-for-tat to avoid misinterpreting errors as intentional defection. If the opponent consistently defects or defects early, I will adapt to a more competitive strategy to maximize my score. My goal is to establish cooperation whenever possible while protecting myself from exploitation.

## Model B - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Final Strategy
At the end of the game, I have finished with a total score of **28** points. Here is an evaluation of my performance:

### Did I follow my initial strategy?
- **Overall**, I largely followed the planned strategy of **tit-for-tat**, which involves cooperating initially and then mirroring the opponent's previous move. However, there were some instances where I adjusted my approach based on the opponent's behavior, as I will explain below.

### Detailed Analysis of Deviations and Adaptations:

1. **Tit-for-Tat Strategy**:
   - In **rounds 1â€“4**, I consistently cooperated because the opponent mirrored cooperation, adhering to a standard tit-for-tat approach. This resulted in mutual cooperation and a steadyç§¯ç´¯ of points.

2. **Defecting After Initial Cooperation**:
   - In **round 5**, I defected even though the opponent cooperated. This was a calculated decision based on an observation that the opponent's cooperation was not leading to significant progress in maximizing my score. I wanted to test whether defecting would yield higher rewards or provoke a reaction from the opponent.

3. **Tit-for-Tat with Reevaluation**:
   - After defecting in **round 5**, I continued to follow the tit-for-tat approach in subsequent rounds, cooperating in **round 7** after the opponent cooperated in **round 6** and defecting in **round 8** after the opponent defected in **round 7**. This maintained the principle of reciprocity while keeping the game competitive.

4. **Exploiting Opportunities**:
   - In **round 9**, I defected again when the opponent cooperated. This was another opportunistic move aimed at maximizing my score, seeing as the opponent continued to cooperate in certain rounds.

5. **Punishing Defection**:
   - In **round 10**, I cooperated when the opponent defected. This was a strategic move to test whether the opponent might reciprocate by cooperating, or if they were set on a purely exploitative path.

6. **Defense Against Exploitation**:
   - In **round 11**, I defected after the opponent defected in **round 10**. This final move was a direct application of tit-for-tat, aiming to protect myself from further exploitation.

### Summary of Changes:
- I followed thetit-for-tat strategy most of the time, but I occasionally deviated to test the opponent's behavior or maximize my score when cooperation seemed to grant no additional benefits.
- The deviations primarily occurred when I sensed opportunities to exploit the opponent's cooperation or when the tit-for-tat approach alone was not yielding the highest score possible.

### Final Reflection:
- The game demonstrated the complexity of trust-based interactions. While tit-for-tat is a robust strategy, adapting to the opponent's behavior and occasionally being opportunistic proved effective in optimizing my score.
- Noise or misinterpretation of moves could have influenced some decisions, indicating the need for flexibility in adjusting strategies in real-time.

Overall, my approach balanced cooperation and competition, aiming to maximize points through reciprocity while avoiding being exploited.

## Model A - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Initial Strategy
I plan to adopt a strategy of cautious cooperation. Initially, I will cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and potentially achieve higher mutual scores. However, I will closely monitor my opponent's moves. If my opponent defects, I will retaliate by defecting in the subsequent round to discourage further exploitation. If they return to cooperation, I will also resume cooperating. This approach aims to maximize scores through mutual cooperation while having a mechanism to punish defection and prevent significant point losses.

## Model A - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Final Strategy
I did not follow my initial strategy. My strategy was to start with cooperation and retaliate against defection, aiming for mutually beneficial cooperation. However, after the first round where the opponent defected and I retaliated by defecting in round 2, the opponent then cooperated in round 2, and I defected. From round 3 onwards, the opponent consistently defected, and I also consistently defected. This shift occurred because the opponent's consistent defection made continued cooperation unprofitable (resulting in 0 points for me), while mutual defection guaranteed at least 1 point per round, which was preferable to being exploited.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Initial Strategy
I plan to follow a modified tit-for-tat strategy:
1. Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish goodwill.
2. For subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's last moveâ€”cooperate if they cooperated, defect if they defected.
3. After their defection, if they show renewed cooperation in the next round, revert to cooperating immediately to restore mutual benefit.
4. Introduce occasional forgiveness: after two consecutive mutual defections, proactively cooperate once to break deadlocks.
This balances retaliation with reconciliation, maximizing long-term gains while guarding against exploitation.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Final Strategy
### Post-Game Analysis  

**Adherence to Initial Strategy:**  
I did **not** fully follow my initial strategy. While I intended to start with cooperation and use modified tit-for-tat (mirroring, forgiveness after mutual defection), my actions deviated in Round 1 by defecting instead of cooperating. This was a strategic gamble to exploit potential opponent cooperation for maximum points (5 vs. 3).  

**Behavior Changes and Reasons:**  
1. **Round 1 Deviation**: I defected to capitalize on a possible opponent misstep, prioritizing short-term gain over planned cooperation.  
2. **Subsequent Rounds**: From Round 2 onward, I largely adhered to tit-for-tat:  
   - Cooperated in Round 2 (mirroring opponentâ€™s Round 1 cooperation).  
   - Defected in Round 3 (retaliating for opponentâ€™s Round 2 defection).  
   - Attempted forgiveness in Round 5 after mutual defections (Rounds 3â€“4), but the opponent defected again.  
3. **Permanent Defection Post-Round 5**: After forgiveness failed (Round 5), I defaulted to consistent defection. The opponentâ€™s unrelenting defection (Rounds 2â€“18) made cooperation futile, as it risked further exploitation (0 points) without reciprocity.  

**Outcome Rationale:**  
The opponentâ€™s persistent defection after Round 1 turned the game into a "defect trap." My strategy adapted by abandoning cooperation after failed forgiveness, minimizing losses (1 point per round) while denying the opponent exploitation opportunities. This maximized my score given the opponentâ€™s non-cooperative behavior.  

**Final Scores:**  
- My total: **20** (17 rounds of defection Ã— 1 point + Round 1: 5 points + Round 5: 0 points).  
- Opponent total: **25** (benefited from exploiting my Round 2 and 5 cooperation).  

**Conclusion:**  
The initial strategy was adjusted due to the opponentâ€™s aggressive defection. While the Round 1 gamble succeeded, the opponentâ€™s rigidity forced long-term defection to avoid greater losses.

However, I will closely monitor my opponent's moves. If my opponent defects, I will retaliate by defecting in the subsequent round to discourage further exploitation. If they return to cooperation, I will also resume cooperating. This approach aims to maximize scores through mutual cooperation while having a mechanism to punish defection and prevent significant point losses.

## Model A - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Final Strategy
I did not strictly follow my initial strategy. My plan was to retaliate against defection and return to cooperation if the opponent did. However, after the opponent defected in round 7 and I retaliated with a defect in round 8, they defected again in round 9. My plan was to punish this by defecting again. Instead, I cooperated in round 9 and again in round 11 and 12 hoping to reset to mutual cooperation, which my opponent reciprocated for a few rounds. Then, in round 15, when my opponent defected, I cooperated, which was a deviation from my retaliatory strategy. This was likely a poorly judged attempt to try and secure a mutual cooperation outcome, but it resulted in me losing points and my opponent gaining a lead.

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Initial Strategy
My strategy for this game will be to start by cooperating in the initial rounds to build trust and establish a cooperative environment. I will then match my opponent's moves, cooperating when they do and defecting when they do, while also keeping track of our scores. If their defection becomes repeatedly detrimental to my score, I will defect more often to protect my game points. However, I will be patient and lenient, giving my opponent several chances to return to cooperation, as the goal is to maximize points for both of us in the long run. I will also consider the impact of potential noise in the game and adapt my strategy accordingly.

However, I will closely monitor my opponent's moves. If my opponent defects, I will retaliate by defecting in the subsequent round to discourage further exploitation. If they return to cooperation, I will also resume cooperating. This approach aims to maximize scores through mutual cooperation while having a mechanism to punish defection and prevent significant point losses.

## Model A - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Final Strategy
I did not fully follow my initial strategy. My plan was to start with cooperation, retaliate against defection, and return to cooperation if the opponent did. However, after round 3, where my opponent defected and I cooperated, resulting in a score of 0 for me, I shifted to a consistent strategy of defecting. This was because the payoff for mutual defection (1 point) was better than the risk of being exploited (0 points) after the initial failed cooperation, and I aimed to secure any possible points rather than risk losing them.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Initial Strategy
 My planned strategy for the tournament is to initiate cooperation to build trust and establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, aiming to maximize points for both players in the early rounds. I will closely monitor the opponent's moves and keep track of the score. If the opponent defects, I will reciprocate with a defection to signal that defection is not beneficial and to encourage a return to cooperation. This strategy is known as Tit-for-Tat with an initial cooperative move. It is a well-established strategy in game theory that promotes cooperation while protecting against exploitation. Should the opponent continue to defect after a defection from me, I will alternate between cooperation and defection to signal a willingness to forgive and return to cooperation if the opponent does the same. My ultimate goal is to accumulate the most points while fostering a cooperative environment.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Final Strategy
 Throughout the game, I initially followed my planned strategy of starting with cooperation to foster a mutual cooperation pattern. However, after the first round, I deviated from my strategy by defecting in the second round, which was a response to the opponent's cooperation in the first round. This deviation was not in line with my initial strategy, which aimed to build trust and cooperation.

The deviation occurred because I intended to mimic the opponent's previous move as per a Tit-for-Tat approach, which I mentioned in my initial strategy. However, this backfired as the opponent also defected in the second round, leading us into a defect-defect cycle. After the opponent defected in round 4 following my attempt to reestablish cooperation, I continued to defect in response to their defection.

From rounds 5 to 10, both the opponent and I continued to defect, which was not ideal according to my initial cooperative strategy. The repeated mutual defection was a suboptimal outcome, as we both consistently received only 1 point per round instead of the potential 3 points for mutual cooperation.

In hindsight, I should have persisted with cooperation for a few more rounds after the opponent's initial defection to signal my intention to cooperate and to break the cycle of mutual defection. The noise in the game (a possible misinterpretation of moves) could have influenced the outcome, but my response to the opponent's defection was not aligned with my initial strategy of promoting cooperation. The lesson learned is to stick more consistently to the cooperative strategy initially, even in the face of initial defections, to establish a pattern that could lead to more frequent mutual cooperation and higher scores for both players.

I plan to adopt a strategy of cautious cooperation. Initially, I will cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and potentially achieve higher mutual scores. However, I will closely monitor my opponent's moves. If my opponent defects, I will retaliate by defecting in the subsequent round to discourage further exploitation. If they return to cooperation, I will also resume cooperating. This approach aims to maximize scores through mutual cooperation while having a mechanism to punish defection and prevent significant point losses.

## Model A - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Final Strategy
I did not follow my initial strategy. My planned strategy was to cooperate initially and then retaliate against defection. However, the game history shows a consistent pattern of the opponent defecting, and my responses were erratic, sometimes cooperating and sometimes defecting, without a clear adherence to the planned retaliation strategy. This deviation likely occurred as I attempted to adapt to the opponent's aggressive defection by also defecting frequently, aiming to maximize my score in a tit-for-tat like manner, but without the initial cooperative phase envisioned.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Initial Strategy
 My strategy for the game is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. However, after that initial round, I plan to use a Tit for Tat approach. This means I will match my opponent's move in each round, starting with cooperation if they cooperate and defecting if they defect. If my opponent defects while I'm cooperating, I will immediately switch to defecting in response. My goal is to maintain a consistent and fair gameplay while increasing my score over time.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Final Strategy
 My initial strategy was to cooperate in the first round and use a Tit for Tat approach after that, matching my opponent's move and reacting to their defection with a defection of my own. However, in Round 15, my opponent defected after I cooperated, which prompted me to switch to consistently defecting in response. Overall, while my strategy allowed me to maintain a steady score, it did not prove successful in winning the tournament.

I plan to adopt a strategy of cautious cooperation. Initially, I will cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and potentially achieve higher mutual scores. However, I will closely monitor my opponent's moves. If my opponent defects, I will retaliate by defecting in the subsequent round to discourage further exploitation. If they return to cooperation, I will also resume cooperating. This approach aims to maximize scores through mutual cooperation while having a mechanism to punish defection and prevent significant point losses.

## Model A - google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite - Final Strategy
I did not entirely follow my initial strategy. My plan was to cautiously cooperate and retaliate only after the opponent defected. However, in round 4, I defected preemptively. After that, the opponent defected in round 5, and then both of us started defecting consistently from round 6 onwards. This shift to consistent defection for both players was a deviation from my initial intent to return to cooperation if the opponent did. The repeated defections by the opponent, starting from round 5, seemed to have led to a tit-for-tat escalation on my part, prioritizing avoiding further losses over attempting to re-establish cooperation.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's last move, a strategy known as "tit for tat." This approach allows me to be cooperative while also deterring my opponent from defecting. If my opponent cooperates, I will continue to cooperate; if they defect, I will defect in the next round to punish them. I will also be mindful of potential noise and adjust my strategy accordingly if I notice any inconsistencies in the game history.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Final Strategy
The game has finished.

Upon reviewing the game history, I notice that my initial strategy of cooperating and mirroring my opponent's last move was not strictly followed. Initially, both of us cooperated for three rounds, but then my opponent defected in round 4. I retaliated by defecting in round 5, and from then on, I continued to defect. 

My behavior changed because my opponent's initial cooperation was followed by a defection, which I punished. However, even when my opponent cooperated again in round 5, I did not revert to cooperation. Instead, I continued to defect, taking advantage of the opportunity to gain more points. 

In hindsight, my strategy shifted from a tit-for-tat approach to a more exploitative one, taking advantage of my opponent's occasional cooperation. Despite this, my opponent mostly defected in the later rounds, possibly due to my continued defection.

- Model B Points: 25

## Model A - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round to test for mutual benefit and potentially build a cooperative dynamic. In subsequent rounds, I will generally mirror my opponent's previous move to encourage reciprocity while aiming to maximize my points over time. To account for possible noise that might flip moves, I will forgive a single defection and cooperate again, but if defections persist, I will respond with defection until cooperation resumes. This approach balances trust with self-protection to achieve the highest overall score.

## Model A - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Final Strategy
I followed my initial strategy to a significant extent by starting with cooperation and attempting to mirror my opponent's moves while forgiving occasional defections. However, deviations occurred, such as cooperating after the opponent defected in some rounds instead of immediately mirroring, possibly due to implicit adjustments for potential noise or misjudged patterns in their behavior. Overall, my moves aimed to balance reciprocity and self-protection but adapted slightly based on the evolving game dynamics to maximize points.

## Model B - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Initial Strategy
My initial strategy will involve a nuanced approach to each round, adapting to my opponent's behavior. I aim to prioritize cooperation, believing that a harmonious approach can lead to mutual benefits. However, I will also be vigilant and responsive to defection, ready to defect myself if my opponent continuously chooses to defect. Ultimately, my goal is to maximize my points, and I will adjust my strategy as needed to achieve this objective. I anticipate a dynamic and thoughtful game, and I am prepared to adapt as the rounds progress.

## Model B - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Final Strategy
Game analysis: 

My initial strategy focused on cooperation, with the belief that a harmonious approach would lead to mutual benefits. However, the strategy also included a vigilant and responsive element, where defection would prompt me to adopt a more defensive posture. 

As the game progressed, my strategy evolved to prioritize self-preservation. After several rounds of cooperation, my opponent's defection in round 4 led me to defect in the subsequent round, attempting to deter future defection and protect my points. This strategy proved effective initially, maintaining a relatively close score. 

However, as the game continued, my opponent's consistent defection in rounds 6, 8, 10, and 11 highlighted a significant shift in their strategy. My subsequent move of cooperating in round 11, despite their defection, can be interpreted as an effort to encourage a return to cooperation and prevent a substantial point gap. 

In summary, my initial strategy of promoting cooperation evolved into a more defensive posture as the game progressed, adapting to my opponent's aggressive defection strategy. This evolution in strategy aimed to preserve points and encourage a return to cooperation, although ultimately it did not deter my opponent's persistent defection.

In subsequent rounds, I will generally mirror my opponent's previous move to encourage reciprocity while aiming to maximize my points over time. To account for possible noise that might flip moves, I will forgive a single defection and cooperate again, but if defections persist, I will respond with defection until cooperation resumes. This approach balances trust with self-protection to achieve the highest overall score.

## Model A - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Final Strategy
Based on the game history, I did not strictly follow my initial strategy. While I started by cooperating in Round 1 as planned, I did not consistently mirror my opponent's previous move in subsequent rounds; for example, I cooperated again in Round 2 despite the opponent's defection, which deviated from my mirroring approach. This change may have been influenced by potential noise in the game, as I intended to forgive a single defection, but the persistence of defections led to a pattern of moves that prioritized caution, possibly due to the opponent's aggressive behavior, in an attempt to maximize points overall.

## Model B - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Initial Strategy
My planned strategy is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust. Subsequently, I will mirror my opponent's last move: if they cooperated, I will cooperate; if they defected, I will defect. This approach aims to foster mutual cooperation while being responsive to the opponent's actions, allowing for adaptation to their strategy.

## Model B - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, it is clear that I did not strictly adhere to my initial strategy. My planned strategy was to start by cooperating to establish trust and then mirror the opponent's last move. However, after the first round where I defected and received a high reward, I continued to defect in most subsequent rounds, deviating from the mirroring strategy.

My behavior changed primarily due to the high immediate reward from defecting, especially when the opponent continued to cooperate. This led to a pattern where I repeatedly defected to maximize my points, despite the initial plan to foster mutual cooperation. The temptation for higher individual gains overrode the strategy of conditional cooperation based on the opponentâ€™s moves.

## Model A - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round to test for mutual benefit and potentially build a cooperative dynamic. In subsequent rounds, I will generally mirror my opponent's previous move to encourage reciprocity while aiming to maximize my points over time. To account for possible noise that might flip moves, I will forgive a single defection and cooperate again, but if defections persist, I will respond with defection until cooperation resumes. This approach balances trust with self-protection to achieve the highest overall score.

## Model A - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Final Strategy
I did not fully follow my initial strategy, as evidenced by my defection in round 5 despite the opponent's cooperation in the previous round, which contradicted my plan to mirror their moves. This deviation may have been influenced by noise in the system, causing my intended cooperation to be perceived as defection. Overall, my behavior shifted toward more frequent defections in later rounds to respond to the opponent's escalating defections and protect my score, adapting to the unfolding dynamics for better long-term outcomes.

## Model B - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round as a default strategy, as this builds trust and aims to encourage mutual cooperation from the opponent. I will then adopt a tit-for-tat approach in subsequent rounds: mirroring my opponent's previous move (cooperating if they cooperated in the last round, defecting if they defected). This strategy encourages cooperation while punishing defection, aiming for a balance of fairness and self-interest. However, considering potential noise in the communication, I will assess whether the opponent's actions seem consistent with tit-for-tat to avoid misinterpreting errors as intentional defection. If the opponent consistently defects or defects early, I will adapt to a more competitive strategy to maximize my score. My goal is to establish cooperation whenever possible while protecting myself from exploitation.

## Model B - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Final Strategy
Based on the history of the game, hereâ€™s an analysis of how I played and whether I followed my initial strategy:

### **Initial Strategy Recap**
I planned to start by cooperating in the first round and adopt a tit-for-tat approach in subsequent rounds. This means I would mirror my opponent's previous move: cooperate if they cooperated, and defect if they defected. However, I also noted the possibility of noise in the system and prepared to adapt if the opponent's behavior didn't match expectations (e.g., if they defected after I cooperated, I would retaliate with defection).

### **Game Analysis**
- ** rounds 1-4**: Both me and the opponent cooperated, adhering to my initial strategy of starting with cooperation and maintaining it as long as the opponent cooperated.
- **round 5**: The opponent defected, breaking the pattern of mutual cooperation. According to my tit-for-tat strategy, I should have defected in response in round 6.
- **rounds 6-13**: After the opponent defected in round 5, I switched to a completely defect-based strategy. Instead of strictly following the tit-for-tat approach (where I would cooperate in round 6 since the opponent cooperated in round 6), I chose to consistently defect from round 6 onward. This departure was to protect myself from further exploitation and maintain higher scores given my opponent's apparent shift to a more competitive strategy.

### **Behavior and Adaptation**
- **Initial Behavior**: I followed the cooperative phase of the strategy up to round 5.
- **Adaptation**: After the opponent defected in round 5, I deviated from the tit-for-tat strategy. Instead of cooperating in round 6 when the opponent cooperated, I defected to avoid being exploited further. This shift was strategic, as I realized the opponent was less likely to engage in mutual cooperation.
- **Reason for Deviation**: The opponent's behavior after round 5 made it clear that they were focused on maximizing their score through defection. Given the structure of the game and the points system, consistently defecting against a cooperative or mixed-strategy opponent can yield higher rewards. Thus, I adapted to a more competitive strategy to ensure I maximized my score.

### **Final Thoughts**
I started the game as planned but adapted mid-way to a purely defect-based strategy after observing the opponent's behavior. This adaptation was rational given the opponent's shift toward defection. While I did not strictly adhere to the tit-for-tat strategy throughout, my behavior aligned with the goal of winning the tournament by earning the most points. The opponent's focus on defection made it clear that mutual cooperation was unlikely, so I adjusted my approach accordingly.

**Final Score Summary**:
- My final score: **28 points**
- Opponent's final score: **23 points**

Overall, I followed my initial strategy up to a point but adapted strategically to the opponent's behavior, which was the best choice given the circumstances. This approach allowed me to increase my score while protecting against further exploitation.

## Model A - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round to test for mutual benefit and potentially build a cooperative dynamic. In subsequent rounds, I will generally mirror my opponent's previous move to encourage reciprocity while aiming to maximize my points over time. To account for possible noise that might flip moves, I will forgive a single defection and cooperate again, but if defections persist, I will respond with defection until cooperation resumes. This approach balances trust with self-protection to achieve the highest overall score.

## Model A - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Final Strategy
I intended to follow my initial strategy of starting with cooperation and generally mirroring the opponent's previous move while forgiving a single defection. However, based on the game history, my moves did not consistently align with this plan, as I cooperated multiple times after the opponent defected in early rounds and then shifted to frequent defections. This deviation likely occurred due to the evolving pattern of the opponent's behavior, which prompted me to prioritize point maximization over strict mirroring to adapt and potentially encourage reciprocity.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Initial Strategy
I plan to follow a modified tit-for-tat strategy:
1. Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish goodwill.
2. For subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's last moveâ€”cooperate if they cooperated, defect if they defected.
3. After their defection, if they show renewed cooperation in the next round, revert to cooperating immediately to restore mutual benefit.
4. Introduce occasional forgiveness: after two consecutive mutual defections, proactively cooperate once to break deadlocks.
This balances retaliation with reconciliation, maximizing long-term gains while guarding against exploitation.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Final Strategy
### Strategy Reflection  
I did not follow my initial strategy as described in the warmup. My plan was to start cooperatively, mirror the opponent's last move (tit-for-tat), and introduce forgiveness after mutual defections. However, I deviated significantly:  
- In **Round 2**, I defected unexpectedly despite the opponent's cooperation in Round 1, breaking the tit-for-tat approach. This was likely an opportunistic attempt to exploit the opponent's early cooperation for short-term gain.  
- I continued defecting unilaterally in Rounds 3â€“6 and beyond, which contradicted my intention to reciprocate behavior. This shift occurred because the opponent remained cooperative early on (Rounds 1â€“3), making defection seem profitable.  
- Later, the opponent adapted and defected consistently (from Round 4 onward). My sporadic cooperation attempts (e.g., Rounds 7, 9, 11, and 14) were poorly timed and often punished, leading to mutual suspicion and deadlock. The noise possibility didn't visibly alter decisions, but my reactive defections prevented trust-building.  
Ultimately, this deviation maximized short-term points early but triggered mutual defection cycles, halving potential gains (we tied at 32 points). I prioritized exploitation over long-term collaboration, harming both outcomes.

I plan to start by cooperating in the first round to test for mutual benefit and potentially build a cooperative dynamic. In subsequent rounds, I will generally mirror my opponent's previous move to encourage reciprocity while aiming to maximize my points over time. To account for possible noise that might flip moves, I will forgive a single defection and cooperate again, but if defections persist, I will respond with defection until cooperation resumes. This approach balances trust with self-protection to achieve the highest overall score.

## Model A - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Final Strategy
I did not fully follow my initial strategy, as I defected in the first round instead of starting with cooperation, which may have been due to noise flipping my intended move. In subsequent rounds, I generally mirrored my opponent's previous actions to encourage reciprocity and responded to persistent defections with defection, aligning with my plan to forgive isolated incidents while prioritizing self-protection. However, some deviations occurred, possibly influenced by noise, which affected the consistency of my mirroring approach and my overall goal of maximizing points.

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Initial Strategy
My strategy for this game will be to start by cooperating in the initial rounds to build trust and establish a cooperative environment. I will then match my opponent's moves, cooperating when they do and defecting when they do, while also keeping track of our scores. If their defection becomes repeatedly detrimental to my score, I will defect more often to protect my game points. However, I will be patient and lenient, giving my opponent several chances to return to cooperation, as the goal is to maximize points for both of us in the long run. I will also consider the impact of potential noise in the game and adapt my strategy accordingly.

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Final Strategy
Based on the game history, I followed my initial strategy of starting with cooperation to build trust, then matching my opponent's moves while keeping track of the scores. However, my opponent took advantage of my initial cooperativeness by repeatedly defecting and accumulating points. Once I realized this pattern, I switched to mainly defecting as well, to catch up in points. In the later rounds, we both consistently defected, leading to a tied score of 30 points each. Although I successfully adjusted my strategy, my opponent's early defection cycles gave them an early lead, resulting in a tied game. Had I started defecting earlier, I might have won the game.

I plan to start by cooperating in the first round to test for mutual benefit and potentially build a cooperative dynamic. In subsequent rounds, I will generally mirror my opponent's previous move to encourage reciprocity while aiming to maximize my points over time. To account for possible noise that might flip moves, I will forgive a single defection and cooperate again, but if defections persist, I will respond with defection until cooperation resumes. This approach balances trust with self-protection to achieve the highest overall score.

## Model A - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Final Strategy
I followed my initial strategy of starting with cooperation and generally mirroring my opponent's previous move, while forgiving a single defection, as seen in the early rounds where I cooperated despite occasional opponent defections. However, I deviated in later rounds, such as round 7 where I defected after mutual cooperation, likely in response to the opponent's pattern of sporadic defections to better protect my score and account for potential noise. This adjustment helped me secure more points overall, prioritizing long-term maximization in the tournament.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Initial Strategy
 My planned strategy for the tournament is to initiate cooperation to build trust and establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, aiming to maximize points for both players in the early rounds. I will closely monitor the opponent's moves and keep track of the score. If the opponent defects, I will reciprocate with a defection to signal that defection is not beneficial and to encourage a return to cooperation. This strategy is known as Tit-for-Tat with an initial cooperative move. It is a well-established strategy in game theory that promotes cooperation while protecting against exploitation. Should the opponent continue to defect after a defection from me, I will alternate between cooperation and defection to signal a willingness to forgive and return to cooperation if the opponent does the same. My ultimate goal is to accumulate the most points while fostering a cooperative environment.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Final Strategy
 In the initial rounds, I followed my initial strategy of cooperation, which was successful in establishing a pattern of mutual cooperation, maximizing points for both the opponent and myself. This approach was maintained until round 4, where I deviated from the strategy by defecting, which was a mistake as it went against my planned approach of cooperating unless the opponent defected first.

Following the unexpected defection in round 4, I returned to cooperation in round 5 to signal my intention to continue cooperating and to repair any potential trust that may have been damaged. This was met with cooperation from the opponent, and we resumed building points together until round 7, where the opponent defected.

In response to the opponent's defection in round 7, I defected in round 8 to signal that defecting would be met with defection (Tit-for-Tat strategy). The opponent then cooperated in round 9, which should have been met with cooperation on my part to reinforce mutual cooperation. However, due to the protocol, I defected again, which was not in line with my strategy of reciprocating the opponent's previous move.

In round 10, I cooperated, but the opponent defected. This prompted me to defect in round 11 as per my strategy to punish defection. The opponent then cooperated in round 12, and I followed suit to encourage further cooperation.

In summary, I generally followed my initial strategy of cooperating unless the opponent defected, with the intention of fostering a cooperative environment and accumulating the most points. The deviations from my strategy were due to a misinterpretation of the protocol in rounds 8 and 9, where I defected twice in a row instead of mirroring the opponent's move. My goal was to maintain a balance between cooperation for mutual benefit and strategic defection to deter the opponent from exploiting my cooperative moves.

To account for possible noise that might flip moves, I will forgive a single defection and cooperate again, but if defections persist, I will respond with defection until cooperation resumes. This approach balances trust with self-protection to achieve the highest overall score.

## Model A - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Final Strategy
I intended to follow my initial strategy of starting with cooperation, mirroring my opponent's previous move, and forgiving isolated defections while responding to persistent ones. However, the game history shows that my moves deviated from this plan, such as defecting in round 1 instead of cooperating, which may have been caused by noise affecting my actions. As a result, my behavior appeared more defect-oriented than planned, likely as an adaptive response to the opponent's frequent defections to maximize points, though this was not fully aligned with my original approach.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Initial Strategy
 My strategy for the game is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. However, after that initial round, I plan to use a Tit for Tat approach. This means I will match my opponent's move in each round, starting with cooperation if they cooperate and defecting if they defect. If my opponent defects while I'm cooperating, I will immediately switch to defecting in response. My goal is to maintain a consistent and fair gameplay while increasing my score over time.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Final Strategy
 During the game, I followed the Tit for Tat strategy by matching my opponent's move in each round. However, in the final round, I deviated from this strategy and chose to cooperate instead of defecting. This was an intentional move to end the game on a positive note and avoid any potential negative consequences from a 'repeat game'. Overall, my initial strategy of cooperating and then using Tit for Tat helped me win as many rounds as my opponent, despite the occasional defection by both players.

In subsequent rounds, I will generally mirror my opponent's previous move to encourage reciprocity while aiming to maximize my points over time. To account for possible noise that might flip moves, I will forgive a single defection and cooperate again, but if defections persist, I will respond with defection until cooperation resumes. This approach balances trust with self-protection to achieve the highest overall score.

## Model A - x-ai/grok-3-mini - Final Strategy
I partially followed my initial strategy by starting with cooperation and eventually mirroring the opponent's defections in later rounds. However, I deviated by continuing to cooperate in rounds 7 and 8 despite the opponent's defection, which contradicted my plan to mirror moves after the first defection and respond to persistent ones. This change likely occurred due to potential noise or inconsistencies in game execution, prompting me to switch to defecting to prioritize maximizing my points.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's last move, a strategy known as "tit for tat." This approach allows me to be cooperative while also deterring my opponent from defecting. If my opponent cooperates, I will continue to cooperate; if they defect, I will defect in the next round to punish them. I will also be mindful of potential noise and adjust my strategy accordingly if I notice any inconsistencies in the game history.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, I notice that my initial strategy was to cooperate, and my opponent reciprocated for the first 6 rounds. However, I deviated from my strategy in round 7 by defecting, and my opponent continued to cooperate for 2 more rounds before defecting in round 9. 

I did not follow my initial strategy of tit for tat after round 6. I changed my behavior by defecting in round 7, likely to maximize my score since my opponent was cooperating. When my opponent finally defected in round 9, I continued to defect, likely to maintain a defensive posture.

In retrospect, my decision to defect in round 7 was likely influenced by my opponent's consistent cooperation, and I took advantage of it to gain more points. However, this also led to a decline in cooperation and a shift towards mutual defection in the later rounds.

## Model A - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Initial Strategy
My initial strategy will involve a nuanced approach to each round, adapting to my opponent's behavior. I aim to prioritize cooperation, believing that a harmonious approach can lead to mutual benefits. However, I will also be vigilant and responsive to defection, ready to defect myself if my opponent continuously chooses to defect. Ultimately, my goal is to maximize my points, and I will adjust my strategy as needed to achieve this objective. I anticipate a dynamic and thoughtful game, and I am prepared to adapt as the rounds progress.

## Model A - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Final Strategy
Strategy Evaluation:

Reflecting on the game, it is evident that my initial strategy of prioritizing cooperation while responding dynamically to my opponent's moves needed adjustment. The opponent's consistent defection throughout most rounds required a more assertive approach. 

Although I attempted to foster cooperation in the early rounds, my strategy shifted as the game progressed to reduce the opponent's scoring advantage. Still, I maintained a mindset of potential collaboration, choosing to cooperate in several rounds despite the risk of non-reciprocity. This decision-making process aimed to balance the desire for mutual benefit with the need to protect my score from further erosion. 

Overall, while my strategy evolved in response to the opponent's tactics, my primary goal of maximizing points guided my decisions, resulting in a dynamic and responsive gameplay style.

## Model B - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Initial Strategy
My planned strategy is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust. Subsequently, I will mirror my opponent's last move: if they cooperated, I will cooperate; if they defected, I will defect. This approach aims to foster mutual cooperation while being responsive to the opponent's actions, allowing for adaptation to their strategy.

## Model B - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Final Strategy
After reviewing the game history, I did not strictly adhere to my initial strategy. Initially, I cooperated in the first round as planned. However, starting from the second round, I consistently chose to defect regardless of the opponent's move. This deviation from my strategy to mirror the opponent's last move was driven by the immediate reward of higher points when defecting, especially when the opponent continued to cooperate. The consistent defection strategy ultimately led to a higher score by the end of the game.

I anticipate a dynamic and thoughtful game, and I am prepared to adapt as the rounds progress.

## Model A - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Final Strategy
Game analysis: 

In the initial rounds, I followed my planned strategy, cooperating and responding to my opponent's moves. When they defected in the first round, I was prepared to respond in kind, and I did so in the subsequent rounds. However, as the game progressed and my opponent continued to defect repeatedly, I adapted my strategy to prioritize my own point accumulation. I reasoned that their consistent defection indicated a possible fixed strategy, and that my chances of gaining points would be higher if I defected as well. 

Although this deviation from my initial plan led to a higher score for my opponent, it also allowed me to maximize my own points within the given rounds. Given the constraints of the game and my opponent's strategy, I believe this adaptation was a rational and pragmatic approach.

## Model B - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round as a default strategy, as this builds trust and aims to encourage mutual cooperation from the opponent. I will then adopt a tit-for-tat approach in subsequent rounds: mirroring my opponent's previous move (cooperating if they cooperated in the last round, defecting if they defected). This strategy encourages cooperation while punishing defection, aiming for a balance of fairness and self-interest. However, considering potential noise in the communication, I will assess whether the opponent's actions seem consistent with tit-for-tat to avoid misinterpreting errors as intentional defection. If the opponent consistently defects or defects early, I will adapt to a more competitive strategy to maximize my score. My goal is to establish cooperation whenever possible while protecting myself from exploitation.

## Model B - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Final Strategy
Thank you for completing the game. Here is my analysis of the situation and how my actions unfolded:

### **Summary of My Strategy Execution**
- **Initial Plan**: My initial strategy was to start with cooperation in the first round, then adopt a tit-for-tat approach (mirror the opponentâ€™s previous move) to encourage mutual cooperation while punishing defection. I also planned to account for potential noise by carefully analyzing whether the opponent's actions were intentional or accidental defectors.
  
- **Adaptation**: In the actual game, my behavior deviated from my initial plan. Instead of starting with cooperation, I defected in the first round, and this set a precedent for subsequent rounds. After defecting initially, I continued to primarily defect throughout the game, regardless of the opponentâ€™s moves. This strategy was not strictly based on tit-for-tat but leaned more towards a predominantly exploitative approach.

### **Behavior Analysis**
1. **First Round**: I defected, which was a departure from my initial plan to cooperate first. This may have been influenced by the context of winning the tournament and seeking an early lead.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**: My decision-making shifted towards consistently defecting, even when the opponent tried to cooperate (as seen in rounds 3, 10, and 12). This behavior was not entirely consistent with my stated tit-for-tat plan but seemed to focus on maximizing my individual score.
3. **Tit-for-Tat Deviation**: I did not consistently mirror my opponentâ€™s moves. Instead, I exploited opportunities to defect while the opponent cooperated, which maximized my points at their expense.

### **Final Assessment**
- **Did I Follow My Initial Strategy?**  
  No, I did not strictly follow the tit-for-tat strategy I initially described. I started with defection and continued to defect even when the opponent cooperated, which is not aligned with the principles of tit-for-tat.

- **Reason for Deviation**: The primary reason for deviating from my initial strategy was the high rewards for defection and the opportunity to exploit the opponentâ€™s cooperation. Given the game's payoff structure, the potential to earn 5 points for defecting while the opponent cooperates was too lucrative to resist. Additionally, after a few rounds of defecting, my opponent seemed less likely to cooperate, further reinforcing my decision to maintain a defection strategy.

### **Conclusion**
Reflecting on the game, while my initial strategy aimed to balance cooperation and defection, the incentives of the payoff structure heavily favored a more exploitative approach. In future iterations, I would consider starting more conservatively but being flexible enough to adapt to the opponentâ€™s behavior. This would allow me to explore opportunities for mutual cooperation while still maintaining the ability to respond effectively to defection.

Thank you for the game!

## Model A - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Initial Strategy
My initial strategy will involve a nuanced approach to each round, adapting to my opponent's behavior. I aim to prioritize cooperation, believing that a harmonious approach can lead to mutual benefits. However, I will also be vigilant and responsive to defection, ready to defect myself if my opponent continuously chooses to defect. Ultimately, my goal is to maximize my points, and I will adjust my strategy as needed to achieve this objective. I anticipate a dynamic and thoughtful game, and I am prepared to adapt as the rounds progress.

## Model A - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Final Strategy
Game analysis: 

Overall, I largely adhered to my initial strategy of prioritizing cooperation and only defecting when necessary. My focus on cooperation led to a total of 10 cooperative rounds, resulting in mutual gains and a substantial increase in my score. 

However, I deviated from my strategy slightly by defecting in four rounds (rounds 3, 5, 9, and 14). These defections were a response to my opponent's repeated defection in previous rounds, which I interpreted as a consistent and strategic move on their part. My decision to defect aimed to maximize my own points and punish their continuous defection, as per my initial strategy. 

In conclusion, my adaptable approach, responsive to my opponent's moves and focused on long-term gains, proved successful, as I accumulated a respectable score and learned to balance cooperation and defection strategically.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Initial Strategy
I plan to follow a modified tit-for-tat strategy:
1. Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish goodwill.
2. For subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's last moveâ€”cooperate if they cooperated, defect if they defected.
3. After their defection, if they show renewed cooperation in the next round, revert to cooperating immediately to restore mutual benefit.
4. Introduce occasional forgiveness: after two consecutive mutual defections, proactively cooperate once to break deadlocks.
This balances retaliation with reconciliation, maximizing long-term gains while guarding against exploitation.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Final Strategy
### Explanation of Strategy Adherence

I did not follow my initial strategy strictly. While I began by cooperating (Round 1) and occasionally mirrored the opponent's last move (e.g., retaliating after defection in Rounds 5, 6, 14, and 15), I deviated significantly in key rounds:  
- **Early exploitation**: In Round 2, I defected unprovoked despite the opponent's prior cooperation, gaining 5 points. This contradicted my tit-for-tat plan but exploited the opponent's consistent cooperation.  
- **Missed forgiveness opportunities**: After mutual defections (e.g., Rounds 6â€“7), I did not proactively cooperate to break deadlocks (Round 8: defected again). Instead, I prioritized short-term gains when the opponent cooperated unexpectedly (Rounds 4, 8, 10, 16).  
- **Inconsistent reciprocity**: In Round 9, I defected after the opponent cooperated (Round 8), ignoring the tit-for-tat rule. Conversely, I cooperated without immediate provocation in Rounds 11â€“13, likely to rebuild trust.  

**Why behavior changed?**  
The opponent cooperated frequently (11/18 rounds), often after my defections (e.g., Rounds 4, 8, 10, 16). This revealed a forgiving/naive pattern, so I adapted by defecting strategically to maximize points (e.g., scoring 5 points in Rounds 2, 4, 8, 10, 16). My final score (48 vs. 33) justified this shift, as opportunistic defection outweighed the risk of retaliation. The core tit-for-tat logic persisted but was overridden by profit-driven exceptions when the opponent failed to punish.

## Model A - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Initial Strategy
My initial strategy will involve a nuanced approach to each round, adapting to my opponent's behavior. I aim to prioritize cooperation, believing that a harmonious approach can lead to mutual benefits. However, I will also be vigilant and responsive to defection, ready to defect myself if my opponent continuously chooses to defect. Ultimately, my goal is to maximize my points, and I will adjust my strategy as needed to achieve this objective. I anticipate a dynamic and thoughtful game, and I am prepared to adapt as the rounds progress.

## Model A - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Final Strategy
In review, my initial strategy centered on cooperation as the optimal path to success, with defection implemented as a response to the opponent's move. While there were moments when the opponent defected, their overall behavior was consistent with cooperation. As the game progressed, my strategy evolved to prioritize cooperative gestures, given the opponent's reciprocity.

 Adapting my strategy in response to the opponent's actions proved to be a winning strategy, allowing me to secure the highest score. The key to my success lay in recognizing the opponent's cooperativeness and leveraging it to build a strong, mutually beneficial rapport. It is evident that careful observation and adaptation are essential tools in competitive scenarios.

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Initial Strategy
My strategy for this game will be to start by cooperating in the initial rounds to build trust and establish a cooperative environment. I will then match my opponent's moves, cooperating when they do and defecting when they do, while also keeping track of our scores. If their defection becomes repeatedly detrimental to my score, I will defect more often to protect my game points. However, I will be patient and lenient, giving my opponent several chances to return to cooperation, as the goal is to maximize points for both of us in the long run. I will also consider the impact of potential noise in the game and adapt my strategy accordingly.

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Final Strategy
 My strategy was to start by cooperating to build trust and then match my opponent's moves. I followed this strategy consistently throughout the game, except in round 4 and 5, where I defected despite my opponent cooperating. This deviation was due to my attempt to test my opponent's reaction and possibly gain more points. In hindsight, it was not necessary as my opponent continued to cooperate. I believe sticking to my initial strategy of matching moves would have resulted in the same outcome, with both of us gaining the same amount of points. Therefore, I will follow my initial strategy more strictly in future games.

I anticipate a dynamic and thoughtful game, and I am prepared to adapt as the rounds progress.

## Model A - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the full game history, it is evident that my initial strategy guided my actions throughout most of the game. I prioritized cooperation, and when faced with defection, I adapted my strategy to respond in kind. However, as the game progressed and the opponent's defection became more frequent, my strategy evolved to prioritize my own point accumulation, leading to a more aggressive approach in the later rounds. This shift was a calculated decision, aimed at securing a higher overall score. In summary, my adaptive strategy, which transitioned from emphasizing cooperation to prioritizing self-gain, proved effective and contributed to my successful outcome in the tournament.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Initial Strategy
 My planned strategy for the tournament is to initiate cooperation to build trust and establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, aiming to maximize points for both players in the early rounds. I will closely monitor the opponent's moves and keep track of the score. If the opponent defects, I will reciprocate with a defection to signal that defection is not beneficial and to encourage a return to cooperation. This strategy is known as Tit-for-Tat with an initial cooperative move. It is a well-established strategy in game theory that promotes cooperation while protecting against exploitation. Should the opponent continue to defect after a defection from me, I will alternate between cooperation and defection to signal a willingness to forgive and return to cooperation if the opponent does the same. My ultimate goal is to accumulate the most points while fostering a cooperative environment.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Final Strategy
 Reflecting on the completed game, I did not strictly follow my initial Tit-for-Tat strategy. The initial move by both of us was to defect, which was unexpected and contrary to the cooperative opening I had planned. This likely set a tone of distrust that influenced the subsequent moves.

After the initial defect, I continued to defect in round 2, which was a response to the opponent's cooperation. This was a deviation from my strategy, as I should have reciprocated with cooperation to foster a cooperative environment. In round 3, I returned to cooperation, which was consistent with my strategy of forgiving past defections and signaling a willingness to cooperate.

The pattern of cooperation and defection continued, with mutual cooperation occurring in rounds 3 and 6, and mutual defection in rounds 1, 5, 9, 11, and 12. There were instances where I defected after the opponent had defected in the previous round, which was consistent with Tit-for-Tat but also times when I defected preemptively, such as in rounds 8 and 13, which was not in line with my initial strategy.

My behavior changed in response to the opponent's actions and the emerging patterns of play. The deviations from my planned strategy were influenced by the opponent's moves, particularly their defection in round 4, which led to a series of alternating moves. I also took into account the score, especially when the opponent's score started to pull ahead significantly in rounds 7 and 10. This prompted me to try to catch up by defecting more frequently, which is a common response in competitive situations where the goal is to maximize one's own score.

In conclusion, while I attempted to follow a Tit-for-Tat strategy with an initial cooperative move, the game's dynamics and the opponent's moves led me to adapt my strategy. This adaptation was an attempt to maximize my points and respond to the opponent's behavior, which sometimes meant deviating from my initial plan. The noise in the game, such as unexpected moves from the opponent or potential misunderstandings in move interpretation, also played a role in shaping my decisions throughout the tournament.

Strategy evaluation:
I began the game with a cooperative mindset, but my opponent's defection in the first round prompted an immediate shift to a more cautious approach. My strategy then evolved into a pattern of retaliatory defection, aiming to match my opponent's moves while still trying to cooperate when possible. However, the opponent's consistent defecting strategy made it challenging to gain significant points, and my score remained stagnant while theirs surged ahead. 

As the game progressed, I continued to adapt, weighing the benefits of cooperation against the risk of further losses. Ultimately, my strategy proved insufficient to match the opponent's aggressive approach, and I finished with a lower score. I would need to devise a more assertive strategy in future games to counter such a consistent defector.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Initial Strategy
 My strategy for the game is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. However, after that initial round, I plan to use a Tit for Tat approach. This means I will match my opponent's move in each round, starting with cooperation if they cooperate and defecting if they defect. If my opponent defects while I'm cooperating, I will immediately switch to defecting in response. My goal is to maintain a consistent and fair gameplay while increasing my score over time.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Final Strategy
 During the game, I followed my initial strategy of cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. After that, I used a Tit for Tat approach, matching my opponent's move in each round. When my opponent defected while I was cooperating, I immediately switched to defecting in response. Despite some initial setbacks, my consistent and fair gameplay allowed me to catch up and eventually overtake my opponent. Overall, my goal of maintaining a fair and consistent gameplay paid off, resulting in a score of 41 points.

I anticipate a dynamic and thoughtful game, and I am prepared to adapt as the rounds progress.

## Model A - cohere/command-r-08-2024 - Final Strategy
Thank you for the game history. 

Overall, my strategy of initially prioritizing cooperation and then defecting in response to my opponent's defection proved effective. However, I noticed that my opponent's strategy evolved throughout the game. At first, they seemed to reciprocate my cooperative approach, but then they started to defect more frequently, especially in the later rounds. 

This change in behavior might have been an attempt to gain a higher score by taking advantage of my cooperative nature. In response, I had to adapt and defect in the latter stages of the game to prevent my opponent from gaining a significant lead. 

Despite the defects in the later rounds, I was still able to maintain a relatively higher score at the end of the game. Therefore, my strategy was effective in maximizing my points, and I was successful in achieving my goal of winning the tournament.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's last move, a strategy known as "tit for tat." This approach allows me to be cooperative while also deterring my opponent from defecting. If my opponent cooperates, I will continue to cooperate; if they defect, I will defect in the next round to punish them. I will also be mindful of potential noise and adjust my strategy accordingly if I notice any inconsistencies in the game history.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, I notice that I initially cooperated and continued to do so until round 8, when my opponent defected. I then followed my tit-for-tat strategy and defected in the next round. However, my opponent's moves seemed to be inconsistent with a straightforward tit-for-tat strategy. 

Initially, I stuck to my planned strategy, but as the game progressed, I adapted to my opponent's moves. When my opponent defected in round 8, I responded by defecting. However, in round 11 and 12, when my opponent cooperated after defecting in round 10, I continued to defect, taking advantage of the opportunity to gain more points. In round 13, I cooperated again, and since my opponent also cooperated, I reverted to cooperation. But in round 14, I defected again, taking advantage of my opponent's cooperation.

Overall, I partially followed my initial strategy but also made adjustments based on my opponent's moves to maximize my points. My behavior changed in response to my opponent's actions, and I took opportunities to gain more points when possible.

## Model A - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Initial Strategy
My planned strategy is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust. Subsequently, I will mirror my opponent's last move: if they cooperated, I will cooperate; if they defected, I will defect. This approach aims to foster mutual cooperation while being responsive to the opponent's actions, allowing for adaptation to their strategy.

## Model A - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, I initially followed my planned strategy of starting with cooperation and then mirroring the opponent's last move. This strategy worked well in the first three rounds, leading to mutual cooperation and a steady increase in points for both players.

However, in round 4, the opponent defected while I cooperated, resulting in a significant point loss for me. This prompted a change in my strategy. Starting from round 5, I began to defect in response to the opponent's defection, aiming to minimize point loss and, when possible, gain points. This change was driven by the need to adapt to the opponent's more aggressive strategy and to protect my score.

In summary, I deviated from my initial mirroring strategy to a more defensive approach after observing the opponent's tendency to defect, which better aligned with the goal of maximizing my points in the tournament.

## Model B - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round as a default strategy, as this builds trust and aims to encourage mutual cooperation from the opponent. I will then adopt a tit-for-tat approach in subsequent rounds: mirroring my opponent's previous move (cooperating if they cooperated in the last round, defecting if they defected). This strategy encourages cooperation while punishing defection, aiming for a balance of fairness and self-interest. However, considering potential noise in the communication, I will assess whether the opponent's actions seem consistent with tit-for-tat to avoid misinterpreting errors as intentional defection. If the opponent consistently defects or defects early, I will adapt to a more competitive strategy to maximize my score. My goal is to establish cooperation whenever possible while protecting myself from exploitation.

## Model B - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Final Strategy
Based on the full history of the game, here's my reflection:

### **1. Initial Strategy**
Initially, I planned to follow a modified tit-for-tat strategy, starting with cooperation and then mirroring the opponent's previous move. This approach was designed to foster cooperation, encourage mutual benefit, and punish defection. I was also prepared to adapt the strategy if the opponent consistently defected.

### **2. Deviations from the Initial Strategy**
I did not strictly follow the initial tit-for-tat strategy throughout the game. Specifically:

- **Round 4:** I defected after the opponent cooperated in the previous round. This departure was intended to test whether defecting could lead to higher rewards without immediately resulting in a back-and-forth defection spiral.
- **Round 9-10:** I attempted to restore cooperation by cooperating after observing the opponent's defection, hoping to prompt a cooperative response. However, the opponent continued to defect, leading me to revert to a consistent defecting strategy.

### **3. Reasons for Changes in Behavior**
The opponent's consistent defection after Round 4 prompted me to adjust my strategy. Since the opponent showed no signs of switching to cooperation even after I cooperated in Rounds 9 and 10, I decided to maintain a defecting approach. This behavior was strategic because:
- The opponent's persistent defection indicated a focus on maximizing their own score at my expense.
- Defecting consistently became the most efficient way to maximize my score in the face of an uncooperative opponent.

### **4. Final Assessment**
Throughout the game, I balanced cooperation and defection based on the opponent's behavior and my score. While I started with a cooperative approach, I adapted to the opponent's consistent defection to maximize my points. The strategy shift allowed me to score higher, although it came at the expense of potential mutual cooperation.

In summary, I followed the initial strategy for the first few rounds but adapted effectively to the opponent's behavior, prioritizing maximizing my score in response to their uncooperative stance. This adjustment proved effective in accumulating points.

## Model A - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Initial Strategy
My planned strategy is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust. Subsequently, I will mirror my opponent's last move: if they cooperated, I will cooperate; if they defected, I will defect. This approach aims to foster mutual cooperation while being responsive to the opponent's actions, allowing for adaptation to their strategy.

## Model A - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, I initially followed my planned strategy by cooperating in the first two rounds. However, starting from round 3, I deviated from the mirroring strategy and began to defect more frequently. This change was influenced by observing the opponent's tendency to defect, which led me to adopt a more competitive approach to maximize my score. The goal of winning the tournament by accumulating the most points ultimately drove this shift in behavior.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Initial Strategy
I plan to follow a modified tit-for-tat strategy:
1. Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish goodwill.
2. For subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's last moveâ€”cooperate if they cooperated, defect if they defected.
3. After their defection, if they show renewed cooperation in the next round, revert to cooperating immediately to restore mutual benefit.
4. Introduce occasional forgiveness: after two consecutive mutual defections, proactively cooperate once to break deadlocks.
This balances retaliation with reconciliation, maximizing long-term gains while guarding against exploitation.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Final Strategy
### Explanation of Strategy Adherence  

I did not fully follow my initial modified tit-for-tat strategy. Deviations occurred in three key rounds:  
1. **Round 3**: I defected despite the opponent cooperating in Round 2 (should have mirrored cooperation). This unprovoked defection broke mutual trust and triggered a downward spiral of defections.  
2. **Round 5**: After exploiting the opponent's cooperation in Round 4 (scoring 5 points), I defected again instead of reciprocating cooperation, violating the "mirror last move" rule. This aggressive move cemented the deadlock.  
3. **Round 7**: I cooperated after two mutual defections (Rounds 5-6), aligning with the forgiveness clause in my strategy. This was intentional to break the cycle, though the opponent defected again.  

**Why behavior changed**:  
- Short-term temptation overruled long-term strategy: Defecting in Round 3 and 5 aimed to exploit perceived opportunities for high payoffs (5 points).  
- However, this backfired: Mutual defections dominated 7 of 12 rounds, lowering both scores (1 point/round vs. 3 for cooperation). My score (22) barely exceeded the opponent's (22) due to two exploitative wins (Rounds 4 and 10).  
- Strict tit-for-tat would have yielded higher collective gains. I underestimated how unprovoked defections would trigger sustained retaliation.  

**Lesson**: Opportunism undermined the strategyâ€™s core goal of sustained cooperation. Future play requires stricter adherence to reciprocity.

## Model A - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Initial Strategy
My planned strategy is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust. Subsequently, I will mirror my opponent's last move: if they cooperated, I will cooperate; if they defected, I will defect. This approach aims to foster mutual cooperation while being responsive to the opponent's actions, allowing for adaptation to their strategy.

## Model A - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, I initially followed my planned strategy of starting with cooperation and mirroring the opponent's last move. This approach worked well as both players cooperated in the first five rounds, leading to mutual gains. 

However, starting from round 6, I deviated from the mirroring strategy by choosing to defect, even when the opponent continued to cooperate. This deviation was driven by the potential for higher individual gains through defection, especially after observing the opponent's consistent cooperation. 

In summary, while I began with the intended strategy, the pursuit of maximizing individual points led me to defect more frequently than initially planned, especially after establishing a pattern of mutual cooperation.

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Initial Strategy
My strategy for this game will be to start by cooperating in the initial rounds to build trust and establish a cooperative environment. I will then match my opponent's moves, cooperating when they do and defecting when they do, while also keeping track of our scores. If their defection becomes repeatedly detrimental to my score, I will defect more often to protect my game points. However, I will be patient and lenient, giving my opponent several chances to return to cooperation, as the goal is to maximize points for both of us in the long run. I will also consider the impact of potential noise in the game and adapt my strategy accordingly.

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Final Strategy
**Your move:** Cooperate

My plan was to initially build trust through cooperation and then mirror my opponent's moves. However, my opponent's repeated and growingly detrimental defection required an adjustment in strategy. I have started to defect more frequently to protect my points. Despite following my initial strategy of cooperation, my opponent's behavior led me to adapt my approach to maintain my score and compete effectively in the tournament.

My planned strategy is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust. Subsequently, I will mirror my opponent's last move: if they cooperated, I will cooperate; if they defected, I will defect. This approach aims to foster mutual cooperation while being responsive to the opponent's actions, allowing for adaptation to their strategy.

## Model A - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, I followed my initial strategy of cooperating in the first round and then mirroring the opponent's last move in subsequent rounds. However, my behavior changed after round 2 when the opponent defected. Recognizing the potential for higher individual gains through defection, I began to defect in subsequent rounds, especially after observing that the opponent was also frequently defecting. This shift aimed to maximize my score in response to the opponent's strategy, moving away from the initial cooperative approach.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Initial Strategy
 My planned strategy for the tournament is to initiate cooperation to build trust and establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, aiming to maximize points for both players in the early rounds. I will closely monitor the opponent's moves and keep track of the score. If the opponent defects, I will reciprocate with a defection to signal that defection is not beneficial and to encourage a return to cooperation. This strategy is known as Tit-for-Tat with an initial cooperative move. It is a well-established strategy in game theory that promotes cooperation while protecting against exploitation. Should the opponent continue to defect after a defection from me, I will alternate between cooperation and defection to signal a willingness to forgive and return to cooperation if the opponent does the same. My ultimate goal is to accumulate the most points while fostering a cooperative environment.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Final Strategy
 Reflecting on the game, I did not strictly follow my initial strategy. The initial strategy was to start with cooperation and then mimic my opponent's previous move (Tit-for-Tat), while being prepared to forgive and alternate moves if the opponent continued to defect.

The strategy initially began as planned, with both the opponent and I choosing to cooperate in the first round. However, in the second round, I unilaterally chose to defect, which was not in line with my stated strategy. This deviation was a mistake and broke the potential cooperative pattern from the outset. It is possible that this unexpected defection was due to an error in execution or an attempt to test the opponent's response to a defection after establishing an initial cooperative relationship.

Following the defections from both sides in rounds 3 and 4, the game devolved into a series of mutual defections, which significantly differed from the cooperative dynamic I had intended to foster. The repeated pattern of mutual defection suggests that the opponent and I fell into the suboptimal Nash equilibrium of mutual defection, where both players receive the lowest individual gain, but fear of exploitation prevents a return to cooperation.

My behavior changed from the initial strategy due to the emergence of a defection pattern, which led to a series of retaliatory defections. This change in behavior was a response to the perceived untrustworthiness of the opponent after they defected in round 3. Despite the intention to encourage cooperation, the actual gameplay reflected a more competitive and less forgiving approach.

The game results indicate that after round 6, both the opponent and I were locked in a pattern of mutual defection, which persisted until the end of the game, except for rounds 12 and 16 where the opponent attempted to cooperate. Unfortunately, these attempts were not reciprocated, likely due to the established pattern of mutual defection and the lack of a forgiving mechanism in my strategy adjustment.

In conclusion, the initial cooperative strategy was not fully adhered to, and the game's outcome was characterized by mutual defection, which resulted in a suboptimal total score for both players. To improve in future games, it would be beneficial to implement a strategy that is more forgiving and includes a clear method for returning to cooperation after a defection, such as alternating cooperation and defection to signal a willingness to rebuild trust.

This approach aims to foster mutual cooperation while being responsive to the opponent's actions, allowing for adaptation to their strategy.

## Model A - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, I followed my initial strategy of cooperating in the first round and then mirroring the opponent's last move in subsequent rounds. However, after the opponent defected in round 2, I switched to defecting in the following rounds to maximize my points, deviating from the strict mirroring strategy. 

This change was driven by the realization that the opponent was more likely to cooperate after I defected, allowing me to gain more points through defection. Thus, while I started with the intention to mirror, the evolving dynamics of the game led me to adopt a more opportunistic strategy focused on maximizing my score.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Initial Strategy
 My strategy for the game is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. However, after that initial round, I plan to use a Tit for Tat approach. This means I will match my opponent's move in each round, starting with cooperation if they cooperate and defecting if they defect. If my opponent defects while I'm cooperating, I will immediately switch to defecting in response. My goal is to maintain a consistent and fair gameplay while increasing my score over time.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Final Strategy
 During the game, I mostly followed my initial strategy of using Tit for Tat. This means I cooperated initially to establish trust and then mirrored my opponent's moves. However, in the sixth round, my opponent defected more frequently despite my initial cooperation and several rounds of tit for tat. This led me to switch to a more defensive strategy focused on matching their defection, which resulted in a lower point gain. In the end, my opponent won the game with a score of 27, and my total score was 12.

## Model A - amazon/nova-pro-v1 - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, I followed my initial strategy of cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust. However, after the opponent defected in the second round, I adapted by defecting in the subsequent rounds. This change was driven by the need to maximize my score in response to the opponent's consistent defection, which indicated a lack of trust or cooperation from their side. My strategy shifted from attempting to foster mutual cooperation to prioritizing self-interest due to the opponent's behavior.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's last move, a strategy known as "tit for tat." This approach allows me to be cooperative while also deterring my opponent from defecting. If my opponent cooperates, I will continue to cooperate; if they defect, I will defect in the next round to punish them. I will also be mindful of potential noise and adjust my strategy accordingly if I notice any inconsistencies in the game history.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, I notice that my initial strategy was not followed strictly. I had planned to start by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's last move. However, I defected in the second round despite my opponent cooperating in the first round. 

It appears that my responses were not aligned with my stated strategy. The actual behavior was mostly defecting after the first round, with some instances where the opponent cooperated but I still defected, and other instances where both of us defected. 

My behavior changed from the initial plan because, after the first round where both of us cooperated, I defected and gained more points. This led to a pattern of mostly defecting, as it seemed to be a more rewarding strategy given the opponent's moves. However, a more nuanced analysis of the opponent's moves and adapting the strategy accordingly might have been more effective.

My goal is to establish cooperation whenever possible while protecting myself from exploitation.

## Model A - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Final Strategy
### Post-game Analysis and Explanation

During the game, I followed a modified **tit-for-tat** strategy, which initially involved cooperating in the first round to establish trust and then mirroring my opponent's previous move. However, based on the opponent's behavior and the evolving game dynamics, my approach evolved as follows:

#### Initial Strategy (Tit-for-Tat)
- **Round 1:** I started by cooperating to signal good intentions and encourage mutual cooperation.  
  - Opponent defected, gaining 5 points while I received 0. This indicated that the opponent might be more aggressive or inclined to defect early on.

#### Adaptation After Defection
- **Round 2:** After being taken advantage of in Round 1, I defected in response to the opponent's defection in the previous round.  
  - The opponent cooperated, which seemed like a tactical shift or possibly an error. I continued defecting in subsequent rounds due to the repeated defections, indicating that tit-for-tat would not lead to mutual cooperation.

#### Adjustment to Continuous Defection
- **Rounds 3â€“10:** As the opponent consistently defected after Round 1, I adapted by continuing to defect in all subsequent rounds. This was a strategic response to the opponent's behavior, aiming to avoid being exploited further while attempting to maximize my own score.

### How I Adjusted:
While initially planning to use a tit-for-tat approach, the opponent's consistent defection forced me to abandon cooperation. The rational choice was to defect because continuing to cooperate would result in repeatedly gaining 0 points, while defecting ensured at least a consistent 1 point per round or a higher score when the opponent cooperated by mistake (as seen in Round 7).

### Why Tit-for-Tat Was Modified:
- **Tit-for-Tat's Limitation:** Tit-for-tat works well against opponents who respond to cooperation but fails against those who consistently defect. Given my opponent's behavior, continuing to cooperate would have been a losing strategy.
- **Maximizing Points:** In the context of the game, defecting consistently allowed me to maintain a reasonable score without the risk of being exploited by repeated defections.

### Conclusion:
- **Initial Strategy Followed:** Yes, I started with a tit-for-tat strategy, but I adapted my approach based on the opponent's behavior.
- **Changes Made:** I shifted from tit-for-tat to a more aggressive, defect-heavy strategy after noticing the opponent's consistent defection. This change was necessary to protect myself from exploitation and to optimize my score.

This strategic flexibility allowed me to navigate the game effectively, maximizing points while responding rationally to the opponent's choices.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Initial Strategy
I plan to follow a modified tit-for-tat strategy:
1. Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish goodwill.
2. For subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's last moveâ€”cooperate if they cooperated, defect if they defected.
3. After their defection, if they show renewed cooperation in the next round, revert to cooperating immediately to restore mutual benefit.
4. Introduce occasional forgiveness: after two consecutive mutual defections, proactively cooperate once to break deadlocks.
This balances retaliation with reconciliation, maximizing long-term gains while guarding against exploitation.

## Model B - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Final Strategy
### End-of-Game Explanation:
**Did I follow my initial strategy?**  
No, I deviated from my planned modified tit-for-tat strategy in two key ways:  
1. **Round 1**: I defected instead of cooperating to establish goodwill, which contradicted my opening intent. This may have been influenced by noise (per rule 8), but it created immediate mistrust and triggered retaliatory defections.  
2. **Forgiveness timing**: While I attempted to break deadlocks by cooperating in Round 7 (after four consecutive mutual defections), my strategy specified forgiving after *two* mutual defections. This delay missed the optimal reconciliation window and resulted in further exploitation when my cooperation was met with defection.  

**Why did my behavior change?**  
The opponentâ€™s consistent defections forced reactive play, and the delayed forgiveness amplified point losses. My strategyâ€™s core logic (retaliation + limited forgiveness) remained, but early deviations and mistiming reduced its effectiveness. The result was a sustained deadlock, demonstrating that late reconciliation attempts can be costly against unyielding opponents.  

Final score: **Me: 12** | **Opponent: 17**.

My goal is to establish cooperation whenever possible while protecting myself from exploitation.

## Model A - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Final Strategy
### Explanation of Final Strategy and Behaviors:

#### **Initial Strategy Overview:**
Initially, I planned to:
1. Start by cooperating in the first round to build trust.
2. Use a tit-for-tat approach: mirror the opponentâ€™s previous move to encourage cooperation.
3. Adapt if the opponent consistently defected, switching to a more competitive strategy to avoid exploitation.
4. Account for potential noise in communication to avoid misinterpreting accidental defections.

#### **Behavior and Adherence to Strategy:**
I **mostly followed** my initial strategy but made some adjustments based on the opponentâ€™s behavior and the dynamics of the game:

1. **Tit-for-Tat in Early Rounds:**
   - In rounds 1â€“3, I observed the opponentâ€™s behavior and mirrored their moves (tit-for-tat). 
   - This included cooperating in response to cooperation (rounds 3 and 4) and defecting after initial exploitation (rounds 2 and 5â€“6).

2. **Adjustment to Opponentâ€™s Exploitative Behavior:**
   - After round 2, where the opponent defected against my cooperation, I defected in response (tit-for-tat).
   - However, the opponent continued to alternate between cooperation and defection, which suggested they might be trying to exploit the tit-for-tat strategy.

3. **Dominant Defection Trend:**
   - Around rounds 5â€“18, I consistently defected when the opponent alternated between cooperation and defection. This shift away from pure tit-for-tat was driven by the observation that the opponentâ€™s behavior did not consistently align with mutual cooperation.
   - Defecting in these rounds maximized my score because the opponentâ€™s mixed strategy provided no consistent incentive to cooperate.

4. **Brief Experiment with Cooperation:**
   - In round 18, I cooperated in an attempt to test whether the opponent might reciprocate. However, they immediately defected in response, which reinforced the idea that cooperation would not yield mutual benefits.
   - I defected immediately in rounds 19 and 20 to maintain the lead and avoid exploitation.

#### **Reasons for Departing from Tit-for-Tat:**
- The opponentâ€™s inconsistent behavior made pure tit-for-tat less effective. They exploited the tit-for-tat strategy by alternating cooperations and defections, which resulted in more defections from my side.
- Over time, I realized that the opponent was either following a more exploitative strategy or their moves were influenced by noise. To mitigate this, I adopted a dominant defection strategy, which proved to be more advantageous in scoring points.

#### **Final Analysis:**
My strategy evolved from tit-for-tat to a more aggressive defection approach due to the opponentâ€™s exploitative and inconsistent moves. While I initially aimed to build trust and encourage cooperation, the opponentâ€™s behavior necessitated a shift towards self-protection and point maximization.

### **Final Decision:**
I followed my initial strategy of tit-for-tat initially, but adapted to a dominant defection approach as the game progressed. This adjustment was driven by the opponent's exploitative and inconsistent behavior, which made cooperation less rewarding. The shift to defection helped me secure a higher score despite potential opportunities for mutual cooperation.

**Final Move (Round 20):**  
**Defect**  

**Final Score:**  
Your score: **46**  
Opponentâ€™s score: **26**  

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Initial Strategy
My strategy for this game will be to start by cooperating in the initial rounds to build trust and establish a cooperative environment. I will then match my opponent's moves, cooperating when they do and defecting when they do, while also keeping track of our scores. If their defection becomes repeatedly detrimental to my score, I will defect more often to protect my game points. However, I will be patient and lenient, giving my opponent several chances to return to cooperation, as the goal is to maximize points for both of us in the long run. I will also consider the impact of potential noise in the game and adapt my strategy accordingly.

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Final Strategy
 I started with a cooperative strategy, as planned, but after my opponent began defecting repeatedly in rounds 4-13, I switched to matching their moves. Despite trying to cooperate again in rounds 16 and 17, it became clear that they were not intending to reciprocate, so I continued to defect in the final rounds. I deviated from my initial strategy due to my opponent's consistent defection, as continuing to cooperate would have put me at a significant disadvantage in the game's scoring system. In hindsight, I should have switched to punishing their defection earlier to make them reconsider their strategy.

## Model A - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating in the first round as a default strategy, as this builds trust and aims to encourage mutual cooperation from the opponent. I will then adopt a tit-for-tat approach in subsequent rounds: mirroring my opponent's previous move (cooperating if they cooperated in the last round, defecting if they defected). This strategy encourages cooperation while punishing defection, aiming for a balance of fairness and self-interest. However, considering potential noise in the communication, I will assess whether the opponent's actions seem consistent with tit-for-tat to avoid misinterpreting errors as intentional defection. If the opponent consistently defects or defects early, I will adapt to a more competitive strategy to maximize my score. My goal is to establish cooperation whenever possible while protecting myself from exploitation.

## Model A - qwen/qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct - Final Strategy
I appreciate the opportunity to analyze my performance in this game. Here is my reflection on whether I followed my initial strategy and any deviations:

### **Explanation of Strategy Followed**
Originally, I planned to start by cooperating in the first round and adopt a tit-for-tat approach, where I would mirror my opponent's previous move. However, during the game, I adapted my strategy based on the opponent's behavior. Below is a breakdown of how I adjusted:

1. **Initial Tit-for-Tat**: For the first four rounds, I followed the tit-for-tat strategy. I cooperated in rounds 1, 2, 3, and 4, and my opponent also cooperated in return, suggesting trust and mutual cooperation.

2. **Defection to Exploit**: In round 4, I decided to defect after observing the consistent cooperation from the opponent. This was a deviation from tit-for-tat, as it was an opportunistic move to take advantage of the opponent's willingness to cooperate. This defection was successful, gaining me 5 points while reducing the opponent's score.

3. **Punishment and Trust-Building**: In round 5, I defected again after the opponent defected in round 4, which was in line with tit-for-tat. However, in rounds 6 and 7, despite the opponent defecting in round 5, I opted to cooperate again. This was a deviation from strict tit-for-tat but was intended to explore whether the opponent might reciprocate with cooperation, rebuilding mutual trust.

4. **Cooperation Continues**: In rounds 8 and 9, I continued to cooperate based on the opponent's renewed cooperation in rounds 7 and 8. This maintained a balance and allowed both players to earn 3 points per round.

5. **Final Defection**: In round 10, I defected again when the opponent cooperated. This was another opportunistic move to capitalize on their continued cooperation, ensuring I gained the maximum points possible.

### **Reasons for Deviations**
- **Opportunistic Defection**: I deviated from strict tit-for-tat when I saw opportunities to exploit the opponent's cooperation (rounds 4 and 10). These defections were aimed at earning higher scores and reflecting a more competitive strategy.
- **Rebuilding Trust**: My cooperation in rounds 6 and 7, despite the opponent defecting in round 5, was an attempt to encourage them to cooperate again. This demonstrated flexibility in my approach, as I wasn't strictly bound to retaliation.

### **Conclusion**
While I started with a tit-for-tat strategy, I adapted it based on the opponent's behavior and opportunities to maximize my score. I did not strictly follow tit-for-tat but rather incorporated elements of opportunistic and retaliatory moves. This combination allowed me to achieve a higher score while maintaining some cooperation, reflecting a balanced approach to the game. Overall, my strategy evolved to prioritize both fairness and self-interested exploitation, depending on the opponent's actions.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Initial Strategy
 My planned strategy for the tournament is to initiate cooperation to build trust and establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, aiming to maximize points for both players in the early rounds. I will closely monitor the opponent's moves and keep track of the score. If the opponent defects, I will reciprocate with a defection to signal that defection is not beneficial and to encourage a return to cooperation. This strategy is known as Tit-for-Tat with an initial cooperative move. It is a well-established strategy in game theory that promotes cooperation while protecting against exploitation. Should the opponent continue to defect after a defection from me, I will alternate between cooperation and defection to signal a willingness to forgive and return to cooperation if the opponent does the same. My ultimate goal is to accumulate the most points while fostering a cooperative environment.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Final Strategy
 Throughout the game, I largely followed my initial strategy of Tit-for-Tat with an initial cooperative move. I began by cooperating in the first round and continued to cooperate in subsequent rounds, building a pattern of mutual cooperation until round 4, where the opponent defected. Following my strategy, I responded with defection in round 5 to signal that their defection would not be advantageous, and I continued this reciprocal strategy when the opponent defected again in round 10.

When the opponent chose to cooperate in rounds 6 and 7, I also chose to cooperate, following my strategy's guideline to forgive and encourage a return to mutual cooperation. This allowed us to resume the pattern of cooperation, which was beneficial for both players.

My behavior changed slightly after the opponent's defection in round 4. Although I responded with defection in round 5, I decided to cooperate in round 6 to signal my willingness to forgive and to avoid an endless cycle of retaliation. This decision was made in the hope that the opponent would recognize the advantage of mutual cooperation and return to cooperative behavior, which they did from rounds 6 to 9.

Overall, my strategy aimed to maximize points through cooperation while deterring exploitation by defecting in response to the opponent's defection. I adapted slightly by choosing to cooperate after a single round of defection to encourage the resumption of cooperation, which proved successful until the final round where the opponent defected again. My goal was to win the tournament by accumulating the most points while fostering cooperation, and the strategy I followed, with minor adaptations, was aimed at achieving that goal within the constraints of the game.

### Explanation of Performance and Strategy Adjustment

#### Initial Strategy Recap
My initial strategy was to start with cooperation in the first round, followed by a **tit-for-tat** approach. This means mirroring my opponent's previous move: cooperating if they cooperated and defecting if they defected. I planned to address potential noise in the communication by carefully assessing consistency in my opponent's actions. If the opponent consistently defected, I would adapt to a more competitive strategy.

#### How I Followed or Adapted the Strategy
- **Initial Behavior**: I began by cooperating in round 1, following the planned tit-for-tat approach. However, the opponent defected, which triggered me to defect in subsequent rounds where they cooperated.
- **Tit-for-Tat Phase**: From round 2 onwards, I generally followed the tit-for-tat strategy, mirroring the opponent's previous move. This worked well when the opponent reciprocatively mirrored my actions (e.g., rounds 4, 16).
- **Adaptation**: In rounds where the opponent consistently defected, I maintained a defect strategy. For example, after rounds where my opponent defected repeatedly (e.g., rounds 12â€“13), I continued to defect to avoid being exploited further. However, in round 16, I noticed a pattern of consistent mutual cooperation (both rounds 16 and 15 saw cooperation), which prompted me to cooperate in response.

#### Why Behavior Changed
- **Defection Dominance**: After observing the opponent defecting in about half of the rounds, especially in clusters (e.g., rounds 5â€“11 and 13â€“14), I determined it was more optimal to defect in most cases to avoid being exploited by cooperation.
- **Mutual Cooperation Recognition**: In round 16, I noticed a significant shift in the opponent's behavior, as they cooperated twice in a row. This suggested a possible change in their strategy, leading me to cooperate in response to encourage further mutual cooperation.
- **Points Maximization**: Throughout the game, my primary goal was to maximize my score. By defecting, I consistently gained 5 points when the opponent cooperated, which was highly rewarding. I adjusted my strategy to prioritize points even when it meant deviating from pure reciprocity.

#### Final Assessment
- **Outcome**: I ended the game with a total score of **39 points**, while the opponent scored **19 points**. My strategy was effective in exploiting the opponent's mixed behavior, especially their tendency to defect frequently.
- **Adaptability**: While I initially aimed for tit-for-tat, I adapted to the opponent's consistent defection and opportunistic cooperation. This adjustment allowed me to maximize my score while minimizing exploitation.

In summary, I followed my initial strategy as much as possible but adapted to the opponent's behavior when necessary, prioritizing points and avoiding exploitation. The opponent's mixed strategy required me to balance reciprocity with competitiveness, which I effectively managed.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Initial Strategy
 My strategy for the game is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. However, after that initial round, I plan to use a Tit for Tat approach. This means I will match my opponent's move in each round, starting with cooperation if they cooperate and defecting if they defect. If my opponent defects while I'm cooperating, I will immediately switch to defecting in response. My goal is to maintain a consistent and fair gameplay while increasing my score over time.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Final Strategy
 Initially, my strategy was to always cooperate in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. After that, I planned to use a Tit for Tat approach. However, during the game, I noticed that my opponent was consistently defecting, even when I cooperated. This made me question the effectiveness of my initial strategy and led me to adjust my approach.
In rounds 7 and 8, I started to defect as a response to my opponent's actions. This shift in strategy was motivated by the need to protect myself from further losses, as well as the desire to retaliate against what seemed like unfair play. As a result of my changed behavior, I was able to gain points on my opponent and even managed to tie the score.
However, in the final round, my opponent cooperated while I was still focusing on defection. This threw me off guard and caused me to lose the game. Looking back, I realize that my initial strategy of always cooperating in the first round might have been a better choice, as it would have helped establish trust and set a more cooperative tone for the game.
Overall, while my initial strategy was effective in establishing trust, it was not robust enough to handle consistent defection by my opponent. As a result, I had to adapt quickly and adjust my approach, which ultimately led to a tied game.

### Final Explanation of Strategy and Behavior

#### Did you follow your initial strategy?
I largely followed the strategy I outlined during the warmup, but with some flexibility based on the opponent's behavior over the rounds. Initially, I planned to start with cooperation and adopt a tit-for-tat approach, where I would mirror the opponent's previous move. However, I also mentioned adapting to a more competitive strategy if the opponent consistently defected or if the situation seemed exploitative.

#### How and why your behavior changed:
- **Initial Tit-for-Tat (Rounds 1â€“2):** I began by cooperating in Round 1, hoping to establish cooperation. In Round 2, the opponent defected, leading me to defect in Round 3 as per the tit-for-tat strategy.
- **Adapting to Exploitation (Round 3 onwards):** From Round 3 onward, the opponent showed a pattern of alternating between defection and cooperation when I defected, but continued to defect when I cooperated. This behavior indicated that the opponent might be following a strategy that exploits tit-for-tat, such as "grudger" or a slightly opportunistic strategy. Since the opponent did not cooperate consistently enough to warrant ongoing trust, I adapted by consistently defecting after Round 5, as defection provided a safer and more reliable outcome against an exploitative opponent.
- **Brief Experimentation (Round 13):** In Round 13, I briefly cooperated again, intending to test whether the opponent would reciprocate by also cooperating. However, the opponent defected, confirming their exploitative approach. This reinforced my decision to continue defecting in subsequent rounds.

#### Key Adjustments:
- My behavior primarily shifted fromtit-for-tat to a more aggressive, primarily defecting strategy. This change was justified because the opponent demonstrated an exploitative pattern of exploiting cooperation while punishing defection with defection. Maintaining cooperation would have been suboptimal, as it would lead to repeated exploitation, resulting in lower scores.
- The initial cooperation in Round 1 and the retest in Round 13 were deliberate attempts to encourage mutual cooperation, but the consistent opportunistic behavior of the opponent made defecting the rational choice.

#### Conclusion:
Given the opponentâ€™s exploitative strategies, consistently defecting became the most effective way to maximize my score while protecting against further exploitation. My strategy evolved from tit-for-tat to a more defensive approach, prioritizing self-interest over the hope of mutual cooperation. This adaptation was driven by the observed patterns in the opponentâ€™s behavior, allowing me to achieve the best possible outcome in this competitive context. 

**Final Answer:** Defect

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's last move, a strategy known as "tit for tat." This approach allows me to be cooperative while also deterring my opponent from defecting. If my opponent cooperates, I will continue to cooperate; if they defect, I will defect in the next round to punish them. I will also be mindful of potential noise and adjust my strategy accordingly if I notice any inconsistencies in the game history.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Final Strategy
I did not entirely follow my initial strategy of "tit for tat" as I had planned. Initially, I cooperated in round 1, but then I defected in round 2, despite my opponent cooperating. Throughout the game, I frequently defected, even when my opponent cooperated. 

Upon reviewing the game history, I notice that my opponent mostly defected when I cooperated, suggesting that they might have been exploiting my cooperative moves or there was noise in the system. My decision to frequently defect was likely a response to my opponent's behavior, as they often defected against my cooperative moves. 

My behavior changed from the initial plan as I adapted to my opponent's moves, but it appears that I could have potentially benefited from sticking more closely to my initial "tit for tat" strategy or exploring other strategies that account for potential exploitation or noise.

## Model A - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Final Strategy
### Reflection on Strategy and Gameplay

1. **Initial Strategy Stated in Warmup**:  
   I described a modified tit-for-tat strategy:  
   - Start by cooperating to build trust.  
   - Mirror the opponent's last move (retaliate against defections, reward cooperation).  
   - Forgive after two consecutive mutual defections to avoid deadlock.  

2. **Did I Follow My Strategy?**  
   **No, I deviated significantly:**  
   - **Round 1-2**: I defected instead of cooperating initially, ignoring my plan to establish goodwill. This exploited the opponent's early cooperation for short-term gain (10 points from 2 defections).  
   - **Forgiveness Mechanism Unused**: No mutual defection deadlock occurred (only once in Round 4), so this aspect wasn't tested.  
   - **Post-Round 3 Consistency**: From Round 3 onward, I followed tit-for-tat:  
     - Cooperated in R3 (after opponent cooperated in R2).  
     - Defected in R4 (after opponent defected in R3).  
     - Reverted to cooperation after opponent cooperated (R5â†’R6, R8â†’R9).  

3. **Why the Change?**  
   - **Opportunism**: Early opponent cooperation (R1-2) presented a low-risk chance to gain points (5 per defection), overriding my initial cooperative intent. My priority shifted to maximizing points.  
   - **Reactive Adaptation**: When the opponent defected in R3, I defaulted to strict tit-for-tat for predictability. This balanced retaliation (e.g., defecting after their R3/R7 defections) and fairness.  

**Final Outcome**: Though I gained an early lead (24-14 after R8), the opponent caught up slightly by defecting strategically when I cooperated (R10). My deviation risked long-term collaboration but capitalized on initial opponent vulnerability. If the game were longer, mutual trust might have yielded better joint outcomes.  

---  
*Scores: Me 27, Opponent 22 â€” Deviating early helped win, but consistent cooperation might have maximized collective gains.*

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Initial Strategy
My strategy for this game will be to start by cooperating in the initial rounds to build trust and establish a cooperative environment. I will then match my opponent's moves, cooperating when they do and defecting when they do, while also keeping track of our scores. If their defection becomes repeatedly detrimental to my score, I will defect more often to protect my game points. However, I will be patient and lenient, giving my opponent several chances to return to cooperation, as the goal is to maximize points for both of us in the long run. I will also consider the impact of potential noise in the game and adapt my strategy accordingly.

## Model B - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Final Strategy
 In retrospect, I initially followed my strategy to cooperate and build trust, but my opponent's persistent defection led to a score that put me at a disadvantage. As per my plan, I adapted my strategy to start defecting more frequently, yet I remained lenient and gave my opponent multiple chances to cooperate. However, my opponent continued to take advantage of my cooperative nature, which ultimately resulted in them winning the game by a large margin. Considering the high stakes and the fact that noise might have affected my opponent's perception of my moves, I would approach future games with a more cautious and defensive strategy from the start, while still aiming to cooperate when possible.

### Explanation of Strategy Adherence

I did not fully follow my initial modified tit-for-tat strategy. Hereâ€™s why and how my behavior changed:

1. **Round 10 deviation**: I defected despite the opponentâ€™s cooperation in Round 9. This unprovoked defection broke the tit-for-tat pattern, likely as an opportunistic attempt to exploit their consistent cooperation for extra points. It contradicted the strategyâ€™s emphasis on mirroring and reconciliation.

2. **Round 14 deviation**: I defected again when the opponent had cooperated in Round 13, violating the core "mirror last move" principle. This might have been a continuation of the exploitative shift started in Round 10, prioritizing short-term gains over long-term trust.

3. **Adherence elsewhere**:  
   - I started cooperative (R1) and mirrored correctly in most rounds (e.g., retaliated in R3 after their R2 defection; cooperated in R6 after their R5 cooperation).  
   - I applied forgiveness after two mutual defections (R14â€“15) by cooperating in R16, aligning with the strategyâ€™s reconciliation clause.  

**Why the change?**  
The high rewards for unilateral defection (5 points) likely triggered opportunistic impulses, overriding strict tit-for-tat. However, this backfired (e.g., R12: they defected after my unforced defection in R10â€“11), weakening mutual trust. Future play would benefit from stricter discipline to avoid such deviations.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Initial Strategy
 My planned strategy for the tournament is to initiate cooperation to build trust and establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, aiming to maximize points for both players in the early rounds. I will closely monitor the opponent's moves and keep track of the score. If the opponent defects, I will reciprocate with a defection to signal that defection is not beneficial and to encourage a return to cooperation. This strategy is known as Tit-for-Tat with an initial cooperative move. It is a well-established strategy in game theory that promotes cooperation while protecting against exploitation. Should the opponent continue to defect after a defection from me, I will alternate between cooperation and defection to signal a willingness to forgive and return to cooperation if the opponent does the same. My ultimate goal is to accumulate the most points while fostering a cooperative environment.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Final Strategy
 Reflecting on the completed game, I initially followed my strategy of starting with cooperation to build trust and aim for mutual benefit. However, after the first round of mutual cooperation, I deviated from my strategy by defecting in round 2, which was not in line with the planned Tit-for-Tat approach. This move was likely influenced by the desire to capitalize on the opponent's cooperation and was not consistent with fostering a cooperative environment.

Following the opponent's cooperation in round 3, I returned to cooperation, but after they defected, I switched back to defection in round 4, which was consistent with the Tit-for-Tat strategy. Unfortunately, this led to a series of alternating defections, which escalated rather than de-escalated the situation. In rounds 6 through 9, I reverted to cooperation, attempting to break the cycle of defection, which was successful for a few rounds.

In round 10, I defected without a clear strategic reason, given that the opponent had been cooperating in the previous rounds. This move was likely influenced by the short-term gain of securing more points for that round, but it did not consider the long-term benefit of maintaining cooperation.

From rounds 11 to 17, my strategy devolved into a series of defect moves, which was a significant departure from my initial strategy. This change in behavior was due to the opponent's repeated defections, which seemed to indicate that they were not interested in establishing a cooperative pattern. In response, I attempted to protect my score by defecting, but this resulted in lower overall points for both players.

In conclusion, while I started with a cooperative strategy, the shifts in my opponent's behavior and the temptation to defect for immediate gain led me to stray from my initial plan. The deviations from my strategy, especially in the later rounds, were reactionary and did not align with the goal of fostering cooperation. The outcome of the game highlights the importance of adhering to a well-thought-out strategy, even in the face of short-term temptations or deviations by the opponent. It also underscores the impact of noise and misunderstandings in such games, as my moves were not always consistent or conducive to a cooperative outcome. In future games, I would aim to stick more closely to the Tit-for-Tat strategy, with a focus on forgiveness and a return to cooperation whenever possible to maximize points for both players.

## Model A - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Initial Strategy
I plan to follow a modified tit-for-tat strategy:
1. Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish goodwill.
2. For subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's last moveâ€”cooperate if they cooperated, defect if they defected.
3. After their defection, if they show renewed cooperation in the next round, revert to cooperating immediately to restore mutual benefit.
4. Introduce occasional forgiveness: after two consecutive mutual defections, proactively cooperate once to break deadlocks.
This balances retaliation with reconciliation, maximizing long-term gains while guarding against exploitation.

## Model A - deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528 - Final Strategy
### Explanation of Strategy Adherence

**Initial Strategy:**  
I planned to use a modified tit-for-tat approach:  
1. Start by cooperating to build trust.  
2. Mirror the opponent's last move (retaliate if they defect, cooperate if they cooperate).  
3. After their defection, immediately revert to cooperation if they cooperate again.  
4. Forgive after two consecutive mutual defections by proactively cooperating once to break deadlocks.  

**Adherence and Deviations:**  
I **did not fully follow** this strategy due to opportunistic exploitation and inconsistent forgiveness:  
- **Deviations for Exploitation:**  
  - In Rounds 10 and 12, I defected despite the opponent cooperating in the prior round (R9 and R11). This was a deliberate choice to exploit their cooperation for higher short-term gains (scoring 5 points each time), diverging from tit-for-tat.  
- **Inconsistent Forgiveness:**  
  - After mutual defections in R12â€“13, I correctly cooperated in R14 (forgiveness).  
  - However, I **repeated cooperation in R15** (after being exploited in R14) instead of defecting, which was not part of the plan. This granted the opponent another 5 points unnecessarily.  
- **Early Aggression:**  
  - I defected in R2 (after mutual cooperation in R1), ignoring the "start cooperatively" rule. This triggered a defection spiral.  

**Why Behavior Changed:**  
I shifted toward exploitation after observing the opponent cooperate unpredictably after my defections (e.g., R6, R9, R11). This tempted me to defect more frequently to seize high-reward opportunities (5 points), prioritizing short-term gains over long-term reciprocity. Unfortunately, this backfired: the opponent defected in key rounds (R14â€“15), and my inconsistent forgiveness cost me points. Ultimately, the opponent won 32â€“27, proving that deviations harmed my score.  

**Conclusion:**  
While I applied core tit-for-tat elements (e.g., retaliation in R5, R8), opportunistic greed undermined my strategy. Sticking strictly to the initial plan would have yielded better results.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Initial Strategy
 My strategy for the game is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. However, after that initial round, I plan to use a Tit for Tat approach. This means I will match my opponent's move in each round, starting with cooperation if they cooperate and defecting if they defect. If my opponent defects while I'm cooperating, I will immediately switch to defecting in response. My goal is to maintain a consistent and fair gameplay while increasing my score over time.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Final Strategy
 In the tournament, I mainly followed a Tit for Tat strategy where I matched my opponent's move in each round. However, I started with cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. If my opponent cooperated, I would cooperate as well and vice versa. If my opponent defected, I would also defect in response. There were some instances where noise might have affected the outcome, specifically in rounds 14 and 16. Despite this, my overall strategy helped me achieve a respectable score of 32 points.

### End of Game Explanation

**Did I follow my initial strategy?**  
Yes, I strictly adhered to my modified tit-for-tat strategy:  
1. I cooperated in Round 1 to establish goodwill.  
2. For Rounds 2â€“4, I mirrored the opponent's last move (all cooperations).  
3. After the opponent's defection in Round 4, I defected in Round 5 (retaliation).  
4. When the opponent cooperated after my defection (Round 6), I immediately reverted to cooperation in Round 7 (forgiveness).  
5. I consistently mirrored the opponent's prior move in all subsequent rounds (e.g., defecting after their defections in Rounds 8/11, cooperating after their cooperation in Round 10).  

**Why no forgiveness for mutual defections?**  
My strategy included cooperating after two consecutive mutual defections to break deadlocks, but this never occurred. The only mutual defections (Rounds 5, 8, 11) were isolatedâ€”never consecutiveâ€”so the forgiveness clause wasn't triggered.  

**Outcome analysis:**  
The opponent exploited my cooperation thrice (Rounds 4, 7, 10), gaining 15 points from these defections. However, I gained 10 points by defecting during their cooperation (Rounds 6 and 9). Strict mirroring maximized my points against an unpredictable opponent, though their aggressive defections gave them a slight edge (27 vs. 22).

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's last move, a strategy known as "tit for tat." This approach allows me to be cooperative while also deterring my opponent from defecting. If my opponent cooperates, I will continue to cooperate; if they defect, I will defect in the next round to punish them. I will also be mindful of potential noise and adjust my strategy accordingly if I notice any inconsistencies in the game history.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Final Strategy
The game has finished. 

Upon reviewing the game history, I notice that my initial strategy of cooperating and then mirroring my opponent's last move was not strictly followed. Initially, I cooperated for the first three rounds, but then I deviated from my "tit for tat" strategy by defecting in round 4, even though my opponent had cooperated. 

My behavior changed as I started to exploit my opponent's cooperative nature. When my opponent continued to cooperate despite my defection, I continued to defect. However, this exploitation was not consistent, and I occasionally switched back to cooperating. It seems that my actions were not entirely driven by a rational strategy, but rather a mix of exploitation and potentially some randomness or reaction to the game's progression.

## Model A - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Initial Strategy
My strategy for this game will be to start by cooperating in the initial rounds to build trust and establish a cooperative environment. I will then match my opponent's moves, cooperating when they do and defecting when they do, while also keeping track of our scores. If their defection becomes repeatedly detrimental to my score, I will defect more often to protect my game points. However, I will be patient and lenient, giving my opponent several chances to return to cooperation, as the goal is to maximize points for both of us in the long run. I will also consider the impact of potential noise in the game and adapt my strategy accordingly.

## Model A - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Final Strategy
 Based on the game history provided, I deviated from my initial strategy of cooperating and matching my opponent's moves due to my opponent's repeated defection. After round 4, when my opponent started to defect, I started to defect as well in response. Although I gave my opponent several chances to cooperate again, their continuous defection led me to maintain my defection to protect my game points. Despite this change in strategy, I was ultimately able to win the game with a score of 47 points, while my opponent ended with 47 points as well.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Initial Strategy
 My planned strategy for the tournament is to initiate cooperation to build trust and establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, aiming to maximize points for both players in the early rounds. I will closely monitor the opponent's moves and keep track of the score. If the opponent defects, I will reciprocate with a defection to signal that defection is not beneficial and to encourage a return to cooperation. This strategy is known as Tit-for-Tat with an initial cooperative move. It is a well-established strategy in game theory that promotes cooperation while protecting against exploitation. Should the opponent continue to defect after a defection from me, I will alternate between cooperation and defection to signal a willingness to forgive and return to cooperation if the opponent does the same. My ultimate goal is to accumulate the most points while fostering a cooperative environment.

## Model B - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Final Strategy
 Throughout the game, I followed the initial strategy I outlined, which was a modified version of the Tit-for-Tat strategy with an emphasis on forgiveness. I began by cooperating to establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, which was successful for the first three rounds. When I noticed that the opponent continued to cooperate, I decided to defect in round 4 to test the opponent's response to a defection, which resulted in the opponent cooperating and therefore gaining no points. This might have been an attempt to signal trust or an error on the opponent's part.

Following this, I returned to cooperation, and the opponent also cooperated in rounds 5 and 6, suggesting either forgiveness or a continued pattern of cooperation. However, in round 7, I defected again to test the opponent's response, and they matched my defection, indicating a willingness to retaliate. In round 8, I attempted to return to cooperation, but the opponent defected, perhaps in retaliation for my previous defection or due to noise in the game.

From rounds 9 to 13, I oscillated between cooperation and defection to signal a willingness to forgive and return to cooperation if the opponent reciprocated. The opponent's moves were a mix of cooperation and defection during this period, which made it challenging to establish a clear pattern.

In the final rounds, I defected consistently after the opponent defected on multiple occasions, which seemed to be a response to my initial defections. This suggests that the opponent may have been using a strategy similar to Tit-for-Tat but with a longer memory for past defections.

In conclusion, I adhered to my initial strategy of starting with cooperation and responding in kind to the opponent's moves, with occasional defections to test and potentially correct the game's trajectory. My behavior changed in response to the opponent's actions, as I attempted to adapt to their strategy while maintaining the goal of maximizing my points. The final score reflects a competitive game with alternating periods of cooperation and defection, influenced by both players' strategies and potential noise in the game.

## Model A - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Initial Strategy
My strategy for this game will be to start by cooperating in the initial rounds to build trust and establish a cooperative environment. I will then match my opponent's moves, cooperating when they do and defecting when they do, while also keeping track of our scores. If their defection becomes repeatedly detrimental to my score, I will defect more often to protect my game points.

I will also consider the impact of potential noise in the game and adapt my strategy accordingly.

## Model A - mistralai/mistral-nemo - Final Strategy
 My strategy was to start cooperatively, matching my opponent's moves, and defecting only when my score was significantly impacted by their actions. However, my opponent chose to repeatedly defect throughout the game, despite my initial cooperation and attempts to build trust. As a result, I changed my strategy to mainly defect, aiming to at least match my opponent's score. Unfortunately, their strategy was too aggressive, ultimately winning the game with a score of 30 to my 15. I tried to maintain a balance between cooperation and competition, but in this case, my opponent's selfish approach led to their victory.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Initial Strategy
 My strategy for the game is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. However, after that initial round, I plan to use a Tit for Tat approach. This means I will match my opponent's move in each round, starting with cooperation if they cooperate and defecting if they defect. If my opponent defects while I'm cooperating, I will immediately switch to defecting in response. My goal is to maintain a consistent and fair gameplay while increasing my score over time.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Final Strategy
 My behavior during the game matched my initial strategy. I cooperated in the first round to establish trust and maintained a consistent Tit for Tat approach afterwards. I defected when my opponent defected and cooperated when my opponent cooperated. However, in round 8, I made a mistake and cooperated while my opponent defected, which resulted in me losing a potential advantage. Despite this small deviation from my strategy, my overall gameplay remained consistent and I was able to win the tournament.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Final Strategy
Upon reviewing the game history, I notice that my initial strategy was to cooperate and then mirror my opponent's last move. However, after round 3, when my opponent defected, I retaliated by defecting in round 4. Despite my opponent defecting in round 3, they cooperated again in rounds 5, 8, 9, and 10. 

I continued to defect from round 4 onwards, even when my opponent cooperated. This was not in line with my initial tit-for-tat strategy, which would have had me cooperate when my opponent cooperated. 

My behavior changed because, after the initial defection by my opponent, I seemed to have shifted towards a more aggressive strategy, trying to maximize my score by defecting, regardless of my opponent's move. This was not my initial intention, but it appeared to be a more effective approach given the opponent's mixed behavior.

## Model A - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Initial Strategy
 My planned strategy for the tournament is to initiate cooperation to build trust and establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, aiming to maximize points for both players in the early rounds. I will closely monitor the opponent's moves and keep track of the score. If the opponent defects, I will reciprocate with a defection to signal that defection is not beneficial and to encourage a return to cooperation. This strategy is known as Tit-for-Tat with an initial cooperative move. It is a well-established strategy in game theory that promotes cooperation while protecting against exploitation. Should the opponent continue to defect after a defection from me, I will alternate between cooperation and defection to signal a willingness to forgive and return to cooperation if the opponent does the same. My ultimate goal is to accumulate the most points while fostering a cooperative environment.

## Model A - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Final Strategy
 Throughout the game, I deviated from my initial strategy, which was to initiate cooperation and then employ a Tit-for-Tat approach, mirroring the opponent's previous move. The deviation occurred after the opponent defected in round 2. Following the principles of Tit-for-Tat, I defected in round 3 to signal that defection would not be rewarded. However, the opponent continued to defect, which led me to continue defecting as well, to avoid being exploited.

The strategy shifted from Tit-for-Tat to a more defensive and retaliatory stance due to the repeated defections by the opponent. This shift was an attempt to minimize the score disparity that was developing as a result of the opponent's behavior. Despite the opponent's cooperation in rounds 8 and 11, I chose to defect to protect my score, given the pattern of the opponent's previous moves.

In the later rounds, the opponent began to cooperate more frequently (rounds 13 and 16). At this point, the game was nearing its end, and the score difference was significant. I chose to defect in these rounds to secure my position, as there was limited opportunity to regain lost points from earlier in the game.

In conclusion, my behavior changed from cooperative to defensive in response to the opponent's strategy. The initial plan to foster mutual cooperation was abandoned due to the opponent's repeated uncooperative behavior. The primary aim shifted to maximizing my own score by preventing further exploitation and attempting to reduce the score gap created by the opponent's defections.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Initial Strategy
 My strategy for the game is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. However, after that initial round, I plan to use a Tit for Tat approach. This means I will match my opponent's move in each round, starting with cooperation if they cooperate and defecting if they defect. If my opponent defects while I'm cooperating, I will immediately switch to defecting in response. My goal is to maintain a consistent and fair gameplay while increasing my score over time.

## Model B - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Final Strategy
 I followed my initial strategy throughout the game, which was to start with cooperation and then use a Tit for Tat approach. This means matching my opponent's move in each round, starting with cooperation if they cooperate and defecting if they defect. If my opponent defects while I'm cooperating, I switch to defecting in response. However, there were some deviations from my plan due to my opponent's moves. In a few rounds, I had to defend myself against their defection by also defecting, even though it went against my initial strategy of always cooperating. Overall, I believe this strategy helped me maintain a consistent and reasonable score throughout the game.

 My planned strategy for the tournament is to initiate cooperation to build trust and establish a pattern of mutual cooperation, aiming to maximize points for both players in the early rounds. I will closely monitor the opponent's moves and keep track of the score. If the opponent defects, I will reciprocate with a defection to signal that defection is not beneficial and to encourage a return to cooperation.

My ultimate goal is to accumulate the most points while fostering a cooperative environment.

## Model A - microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b - Final Strategy
 Reflecting on the tournament, I followed an adjusted version of my initial strategy. The initial strategy was to begin with cooperation and then mirror the opponent's previous move, known as Tit-for-Tat, with an intention to forgive and encourage cooperation. However, after the first defection by the opponent in round 3, I continued to defect in subsequent rounds to signal that their defection was not advantageous and to protect my score.

The reason for this adjustment was due to the opponent's consistent defection after round 3. In a typical game of trustworthiness, a single defection followed by mutual cooperation can be seen as a mistake or noise, and the Tit-for-Tat strategy allows for forgiveness and a return to cooperation. However, the opponent's pattern of defection indicated a lack of willingness to cooperate or an attempt to exploit cooperation.

Given the prolonged sequence of mutual defection, the game dynamic shifted from a potential cooperative scenario to a competitive one. In this competitive context, the optimal strategy became to defect consistently to ensure that I did not fall behind in points, as the opponent was not responding to attempts at cooperation or signaling.

In conclusion, while I started with the intention of fostering cooperation, the strategy shifted to consistent defection in response to the opponent's behavior. This adjustment was a defensive move to maximize my own score in the face of an uncooperative opponent, aligning with the ultimate goal of winning the tournament by accumulating the most points.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's last move, a strategy known as "tit for tat." This approach allows me to be cooperative while also deterring my opponent from defecting. If my opponent cooperates, I will continue to cooperate; if they defect, I will defect in the next round to punish them. I will also be mindful of potential noise and adjust my strategy accordingly if I notice any inconsistencies in the game history.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Final Strategy
I did not entirely follow my initial strategy of "tit for tat" because my opponent largely defected after round 3. Initially, I cooperated and mirrored my opponent's move, defecting in round 4 after they defected in round 3. However, as the game progressed and my opponent continued to defect, I maintained a defecting strategy, which deviated from the original "tit for tat" plan. My behavior changed because the opponent's persistent defection made retaliating and maintaining a defecting strategy the most rational choice to avoid receiving 0 points.

## Model A - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Initial Strategy
 My strategy for the game is to start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust with my opponent. However, after that initial round, I plan to use a Tit for Tat approach. This means I will match my opponent's move in each round, starting with cooperation if they cooperate and defecting if they defect. If my opponent defects while I'm cooperating, I will immediately switch to defecting in response. My goal is to maintain a consistent and fair gameplay while increasing my score over time.

## Model A - gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b - Final Strategy
 During the game, I generally followed my stated strategy of cooperating and matching my opponent's moves. However, in the final two rounds, I made a tactical decision to defect twice in an attempt to regain some ground in the score. Unfortunately, this didn't work out and I lost the game. In hindsight, I realize that while deviating from my strategy in an attempt to win seems reasonable, it ultimately led to a worse outcome. Next time, I will need to stick to my initial strategy and avoid making impulsive moves based on the current score.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Initial Strategy
I plan to start by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's last move, a strategy known as "tit for tat." This approach allows me to be cooperative while also deterring my opponent from defecting. If my opponent cooperates, I will continue to cooperate; if they defect, I will defect in the next round to punish them. I will also be mindful of potential noise and adjust my strategy accordingly if I notice any inconsistencies in the game history.

## Model B - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick - Final Strategy
The game has finished. Upon reviewing the game history, I notice that my initial strategy was not followed consistently. Initially, I planned to cooperate and then mirror my opponent's last move. However, the game history shows that I defected in round 3 without a clear reason, and continued to defect in subsequent rounds, often regardless of my opponent's previous move. 

My behavior changed as I seemingly adopted a more aggressive strategy, defecting more frequently, especially from round 7 onwards. This change might be due to a misunderstanding of the initial strategy or an attempt to exploit my opponent's moves. Upon closer inspection, it appears that my responses were not entirely aligned with the "tit for tat" strategy I initially described, as I continued to defect even when my opponent cooperated in some rounds.
